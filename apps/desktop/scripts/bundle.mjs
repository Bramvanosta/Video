/**
 * The bundled app (L5.16, DESIGN §4p).
 *
 * `pnpm desktop:bundle --out <dir> [--ffmpeg <dir>] [--stage <dir>]` (= `bundle.mjs build`; or RETAKE_BUNDLE_OUT;
 * `pnpm desktop:release …` = `build --release`, the person's signed and notarised run — sign.mjs):
 * stage → sign the payload (dry: ad hoc, sign.mjs) → bundle.json's hashes of the signed files → `tauri build --bundles
 * app --no-sign` with a generated config overlay (never committed: tauri.conf.json keeps `bundle.active: false`, so
 * `pnpm desktop:build` / `desktop:dev` / `desktop:test` — the developer app on the repository's CLI, launch.json version
 * 1 — are unchanged) → sign the shell and the app → verify (the signatures, Contents/Resources byte for byte against the
 * signed stage, attributes, Info.plist: `appProblems`) → then release.mjs `finishApp` (L5.16e fixes: a release re-signs
 * the ad hoc app with the Developer ID there, notarises and staples it; `--app-only` stops before): the update archive,
 * the DMG (`hdiutil create`, APFS, ULFO, an /Applications link; no Finder scripting; tried again on "Resource busy") →
 * verify it (`verifyDmg`: imageinfo; attached read-only, -nobrowse, at a mount point in `<out>`).
 * Everything lands in `<out>` — a dedicated folder (`checkFolder`: outside the checkout, /Applications, the home folder
 * and its Desktop / Documents / Downloads roots, ~/Library; empty or marked by an earlier build: `.retake-bundle`):
 * stage/, target/ (cargo; CARGO_TARGET_DIR when set outside the checkout), app/Retake.app (+ the Applications link: the
 * DMG's folder), Retake_<version>_aarch64.dmg, bundle-report.json (sizes, timings). Offline: Rust with --locked
 * (--offline when CARGO_NET_OFFLINE=true or --offline), the Tauri CLI rebuilt from the pnpm store, every file checked
 * against the sha512 pinned in apps/desktop/bundle/tauri-cli.json — no dependency added (an offline `pnpm add` rewrites
 * the lockfile without the optional platform packages it has no metadata for). Every child of the build — pnpm, git,
 * codesign, tauri and cargo (every crate's build script), hdiutil, xcrun — runs with one allow-listed environment
 * (`buildEnv`): no credential of the person's shell reaches any of them. tauri-build writes apps/desktop/gen (git
 * ignores it): the build puts that folder back as it was (`saveGenerated` / `restoreGenerated`), and the checkout's
 * snapshot covers it.
 *
 * `bundle.mjs stage --out <dir> [--ffmpeg <dir>]`: the payload alone —
 * everything `Retake.app/Contents/Resources` holds besides the shell, staged into a folder outside the checkout,
 * offline:
 *
 *   bundle.json          the manifest core reads (bundle.ts): versions, relative paths, sha256 (of the signed files,
 *                        after `build`: refreshManifestHashes) and sizes
 *   node/bin/node        the Node.js running this script (major 22), re-signed ad hoc
 *   node/guard.cjs       the module lookup guard (+ guard-hooks.mjs; apps/desktop/bundle/): every Node.js the app starts
 *                        loads it first (`--require`), so the app's code never resolves a module above the app
 *   engine/              `pnpm deploy --prod` of @retake/cli, hoisted (no machine path), pruned (maps, .d.ts, .bin,
 *                        playwright-core's browser-channel installer scripts — PRUNED);
 *                        Remotion's compositor with its install names rewritten to @loader_path; engine/templates/
 *                        (the git-tracked starter themes)
 *   browsers/            the Chromium and headless shell revisions the deployed playwright-core pins, from Playwright's cache
 *                        (less the framework's self-install script, which can run as root — PRUNED)
 *   ffmpeg/bin/          ffmpeg + ffprobe from --ffmpeg (relocatable: system libraries only), else none (ffmpeg: null)
 *   plugin/              the Claude plugin marketplace (.claude-plugin/marketplace.json + the git-tracked skills/)
 *   licenses/            Node.js, Chromium, Remotion, THIRD-PARTY.md (the deployed npm packages), apps/desktop/licenses/
 *                        (our ffmpeg's and Remotion's compositor's GPL notices and source offers)
 *
 *   (`build` adds launch.json — version 2, paths inside the app — and bin/retake, the launcher, before signing.)
 *
 * L5.16d, the updater: with RETAKE_UPDATE_FEED (the feed's https address — since L5.16f the repository's update-feed
 * release, `<server>/<owner>/<repo>/releases/download/update-feed/latest.json`, rc.json for a pre-release build:
 * `node scripts/release.mjs feed <version>` — any https feed for a local build) AND RETAKE_UPDATE_PUBKEY (the public
 * key `tauri signer generate` wrote), the build turns the cargo `updater` feature on and the overlay gains
 * `plugins.updater` = {pubkey, endpoints: [feed], requireSignedVersion, allowDowngrades: false} — never `dangerous*`,
 * never in the repository; one without the other is refused; neither: no updater ("Updates are off in this build"). Then, after the app is verified (and notarised), the update archive:
 * Retake.app.tar.gz made by us (`COPYFILE_DISABLE=1 /usr/bin/tar -czf`: the links kept, no AppleDouble file —
 * critique H3, checked against the app: `archiveProblems`) and signed by the Tauri CLI's `signer sign --app-version`
 * with TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY (+ _PASSWORD) — given to that one command only — then verified here against the
 * public key (scripts/publish-update.mjs `verifyMinisign`). Without the private key the archive stays unsigned and
 * the report says so (nothing to publish).
 *
 * `checkStage(dir)` is the layout check run at the end and by the tests on a small fake stage. Never writes inside the checkout or /Applications (`checkFolder`):
 * pnpm imports the injected workspace packages as hard links to the checkout's own files (package.json, dist/), so
 * `deployEngine` gives every linked file of the deploy an inode of its own before anything is written (`breakHardLinks`),
 * `checkStage` refuses a file with more than one link, and `stage` ends by comparing the checkout's `git status` (and
 * the bytes of every file it lists) with what it was before.
