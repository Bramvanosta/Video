# Roadmap — small lots

Every requirement of the brief is tracked in `docs/requirements.json` (source of truth) and rendered in
`docs/REQUIREMENTS.md`; each one belongs to exactly one lot below. `node scripts/requirements.mjs --lot L2.3` lists the
requirements of a lot with their gaps.

Architecture decisions (local-first, desktop-first; flat files as source of truth): `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## Working agreement
- **One lot at a time**, sized to stay readable and cheap: S ≈ 0.3–0.5 M tokens, M ≈ 0.6–1.0 M, L ≈ 1.0–1.6 M
  (reference: phase 1 took ≈ 2.5 M across 6 agents; the spec audit ≈ 0.65 M).
- A lot ends with: build + full test suite green, the lot's acceptance checked (tests, real runs, frames looked at),
  `docs/requirements.json` statuses/evidence updated (`node scripts/requirements.mjs`), `docs/HANDOFF.md` updated,
  one commit pushed to `main`, and a short report (what was done, verification, consumption, next lot).
- The user picks how many lots to chain. Phases 1 and 2 were built autonomously in a cloud session (through L2.14,
  2026-10-12). The work now continues in a local Claude Code session on the user's Mac, on the `main` branch (root
  `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/HANDOFF.md` "Mac setup" / "Order of the next lots"): L1.5 done (2026-10-12: macOS verification;
  it narrowed L1.3 and filled L5.1), L5.1 done (2026-10-12); then, as the user asked: L1.3 (done 2026-10-12) → L1.2
  (done 2026-10-13) → L1.6 (done 2026-10-13) → L1.7 (done 2026-10-13) → L1.8 (done 2026-10-14) → L1.4 (done 2026-10-17), stopping before phase 3 (L3.1).
- **MVP scope is locked** (2026-10-12) to the lots in this file. Any new idea goes to `docs/BACKLOG.md` (unprioritised)
  instead of a lot. The founder adds lots from it: L5.5 – L5.8 (2026-10-26, field feedback), L5.9 – L5.15
  (2026-10-29: the Studio redesign and the rename, captures first, renders on the GPU).
- **Goal for now: a local tool for our own use** (2026-10-12). Commercialisation (plans, licences, cloud, marketplace)
  is a future topic, parked in `docs/BACKLOG.md`; voice-over is an evolution there too (the MVP keeps a silent track).
- The tool stays generic: no client/brand/person names in code, docs, fixtures, templates or test data. The market
  docs (`docs/COMPETITION.md`, `docs/BACKLOG.md`) name third-party products for analysis only.
- Every lot that adds or changes a component regenerates its committed `preview.png` (`retake components preview`).

## Lots

### L1.1 — Phase 1 polish + `retake doctor` (S)
- **Goal:** close the small phase-1 gaps found by the audit and give the user a way to check a Mac quickly.
- **Scope:** invented names in the fixture seed/scenarios/tests/README (R-ISS-10, R-PRIN-01); ripple always visible
  (contrasting ring + derived colour, R-ISS-03); scene-start cursor position configurable (`still: {seconds, cursor}`
  or a target) and auto rest point away from the first target, no visible teleport (R-ISS-04); widget events keep
  strategy/popup/bbox of every click (R-ISS-05); hook/env-reset journals move out of `runs/` (R-ISS-06); motion and
  ripple curves aligned with the field notes, popup fallback delay tuned (R-CHO-03/05/07/09/17); DOM snippet cap
  (R-KIT-10); project `locale` drives the browser locale (R-PROJ-08); missing hook files are errors when a project is
  known (R-VAL-06); new `retake doctor` (Chromium, ffmpeg, display, keychain, notifications, profile, fonts) + a
  `docs/MACOS-CHECKLIST.md` for L1.5.
- **Acceptance:** tests for each item; catalogue + quote re-captured and checked frame by frame (ripple visible on red
  buttons, no cursor jump at scene start); `retake doctor` output in the README.
- **Packages:** runner-web, core, cli, fixtures/wholesale, projects/northfield-fixture.

### L1.2 — Runner robustness for any site (M)
- **Goal:** make the runner work on arbitrary front-ends (SPEC §0).
- **Scope:** resolver pierces open shadow roots and same-origin iframes (R-ISS-07); full-page navigations never show
  loading frames: the recorder holds the last good frame and the timeline marks `loading` intervals (R-ISS-08);
  templating + secrets everywhere in steps with redaction in timeline/log/run.json (R-RUN-16/17); host policy for
  shell/js hooks decided and documented (R-SEC-06); choreography helpers: optional auto-park of the cursor after
  scrolls/results, calendar helpers (last-visible nav buttons, wait previous popover gone), adaptive typing rate,
  React-safe clear, menu trigger re-click and positional last resort (R-CHO-10/13/14/15/18/21/24).
- **Acceptance:** new fixture pages (web component with shadow DOM, iframe widget, full-page navigation) captured
  cleanly; tests per item.
- **Done (2026-10-13):** targets in open shadow roots and same-origin iframes (all in the top kit, top-level px);
  full-page loads held until the new page paints (`timeline.loading`, cut in the edit, `navigation` cuts in the raw
  export; no blank frame left in the fixture captures); every scenario string templated, `{{env:…}}` /
  `{{keychain:…}}` secrets resolved before the browser opens and redacted by path policy from every run file; shell
  and js hooks host-checked (js in a guarded tab, shell scripts read command by command, the unseen cases listed in the
  README / BL-57); `date` action, opt-in `park`, adaptive typing rate, robust `clear`, menu re-click and trigger
  fallbacks. Auto-park is opt-in per step (a scenario-wide switch went to BL-58). Fixture: `embedded`, `reports`
  scenarios. Reviewed by four independent reviewers, ≈ 40 findings fixed with regression tests.

### L1.3 — Capture smoothness under load (M, spike)
- **Goal:** smooth cursor motion even when the page renders slowly (R-ISS-01) and an exact cursor track (R-ISS-02).
- **Scope:** measure on the fixture; try (a) time-dilated capture — slow page animations (CDP Animation playback
  rate), runner motion ×k, encode ×k; (b) per-project "reduce heavy effects during capture" option; (c) beginFrame
  where available (R-ARCH-05); record the drawn cursor position from the overlay (paint time) instead of the dispatch
  time. Keep the option that gives ≥ 24 fps cursor motion without changing what the product looks like.
- **Acceptance:** catalogue capture with ≥ 24 fps during every cursor move (or a documented limit), cursor track
  within 2 px of the drawn cursor during motion (R-ACC-02).
- **Decision after L1.5 (2026-10-12):** on a GPU Mac the slow rendering this spike was written for is gone (≈ 60
  frames/s while the cursor moves, 57–75 over blurred dialogs, 42 of 43 moves ≥ 24 fps, the drawn cursor within 2 px
  of the track in 94 % of moving frames). Time dilation, the reduce-effects option and beginFrame are dropped for the
  local tool (R-ARCH-05 moved to L6). **Narrowed scope:** the stalls the Mac still shows — scripted scrolls and the
  first move after them (R-ISS-11: 0.14–0.43 s frozen, then a jump of up to 329 px), every animated dialog close
  (R-ISS-12: ≈ 0.26 s, the ripple freezes then vanishes), a motion check that sees them (R-ISS-13: longest frame gap during the motion), and the renderer pause on a
  hover-in (R-ISS-02). Acceptance: catalogue and quote on the Mac with no stall over 100 ms during motion or a ripple.
- **Done (2026-10-12):** after a scroll the resting cursor probes the capture with 1 px nudges until frames flow
  again (no stall after a scroll left); before a press the runner waits until a captured frame shows the cursor's last
  move; the motion check judges the motion itself and warns on stalls ≥ 150 ms (shorter hitches are noise). The
  dialog-close stall (≈ 0.26 s when a `backdrop-filter` element goes away, Chromium's frame rate limiter on) stays by
  default: `browser.frame_rate_limit: false` removes it but runs the page's rAF at thousands of Hz (2–6× CPU), so it
  is an option the warning points to (R-ISS-12 partial). Acceptance with the defaults: quote and catalogue twice —
  84 of 84 moves ≥ 24 fps, no stall in a move or after a scroll, dialog closes 186–264 ms during the ripple (warned);
  with the option: no dialog-close stall, one 192 ms hover hitch (R-ISS-02, a documented limit). The raw export's cut
  resume got a 0.2 s floor (new content reaches the screen up to ≈ 0.2 s after its DOM).

### L1.4 — Coverage of untested options + automated fixture acceptance (M)
- **Goal:** every option of the scenario language is exercised by a test (R-ACT-*, R-CLK-*, R-TGT-07, R-MOD-*,
  R-KIT-06/11, R-REC-06, R-RUN-08 signals, R-CLI-05), scale 2 / 2560×1440 / mobile captures (R-GOAL-01, R-ARCH-06),
  `version` fields in persisted formats (R-PRIN-13), golden-image checks of the cursor and file chip (R-LOOK-23/24),
  Postgres tests run in CI-like conditions (R-LES-09, R-HOOK-07), and a slow-suite automated catalogue capture on the
  fixture (R-ACC-05).
- **Acceptance:** coverage table in REQUIREMENTS.md shows no "never exercised" item for phase 1.
- **Done (2026-10-17):** every listed option exercised by a test that fails when it is ignored; 2560×1440, 4K and
  mobile captures; cursor and file-chip goldens with structural checks; signals on the built CLI; `version: 1` on the
  persisted formats (+ run.json engine); `pnpm test:pg` and `pnpm test:slow` (automated catalogue capture); the
  generated "Never exercised" section is empty for phase 1 (`node scripts/requirements.mjs --untested 1`). Fixed on the
  way: `wait_for: {network_idle}` after the first idle, and four cancel / teardown bugs.

### L1.5 — macOS verification pass (S, run by the user)
- **Goal:** verify what this Linux container cannot: headless capture while working, `retake login`, `--headed`,
  Keychain secrets, notifications, capture smoothness with a GPU (R-ISS-09, R-GOAL-08, R-ACC-04, R-CLI-09/10, R-ACT-28,
  R-SEC-02, R-PRIN-10).
- **How:** `pnpm i && pnpm build`, `retake doctor`, then the steps of `docs/MACOS-CHECKLIST.md`; findings go to L5.1.
- **Done (2026-10-12):** every step ran on an Apple M4 (results table at the end of `docs/MACOS-CHECKLIST.md`); step 7
  found stalls after scrolls and at dialog close (→ L1.3) and scene-start defects (→ L5.1); the imports into editing
  tools were skipped (none installed: R-RAW-06 stays partial; the package validates with OpenTimelineIO). Blocking Mac issues fixed in the lot (ffmpeg 9, symbolic-link paths, case-insensitive test fixture,
  a font-sensitive look test; R-MAC-01/02); the rest went to L1.3 (narrowed) and L5.1.

### L1.6 — Sessions & personas (M) — scheduled after phase 2, before L3.1
- **Goal:** never film a login page and support several accounts (two-sided demos, split screen).
- **Scope:** `auth.personas` per environment (profile or storage state, `check`, optional `login` steps), pages/scenes
  bound to a persona, profiles outside git (~/.retake/profiles/…), session preflight before every dry run and
  capture with the exact fix command, login-page detection during runs, optional automated off-camera login with
  redacted secret refs, `retake login --persona`, `retake auth status`, per-run session copies (parallel-safe),
  onboarding in `retake new` (R-AUTH-01..08).
- **Acceptance:** fixture gets a sign-in (two personas: supplier, buyer); an expired session is caught by the preflight;
  a run lands on login → explicit error; concurrent runs on one persona work.
- **Done (2026-10-13):** `auth.personas` per environment (profile or storage_state, check, sign-in patterns, optional
  `login:` steps), pages / scenes bound to a persona (`none` for public pages), masters and snapshots under
  `~/.retake` (never in project.yaml or git; doctor warns), one browser per persona on a per-run copy (parallel
  runs safe, nothing written back — BL-59), preflight before every dry run and capture (automated off-camera login,
  else the exact `retake login` command), a sign-in guard that fails the run and keeps nothing, `retake login --persona
  [--auto]`, `retake auth status [--check]`, interactive `retake new`. Fixture: signed-in side (:4403 / :4404, env
  `signed-in`, personas supplier and buyer); every acceptance item checked on the Mac. A headed sign-in typed by a
  person is the user's MACOS-CHECKLIST step 8b.

### L1.7 — Display URLs, read-only & production safety, frozen clock (M) — after L1.6
- **Scope:** environment pages `{url, display}` (never localhost on screen); `production` + `access: read-only |
  read-write`; read-only enforced by request interception (block or mock mutating requests to the environment hosts,
  allow-list); writing hooks refused; writes in production need project opt-in + `--allow-writes`; access mode recorded
  and shown by review; frozen clock option (R-ENV-01..05).
- **Acceptance:** fixture run in read-only shows the flow with mocked writes and no data change on the server; the
  browser layout shows the display URL; two takes with a frozen clock show identical dates.
- **Done (2026-10-13):** environment pages `{url, display}` (display URLs are edit-time data; a local URL is never
  drawn, reports never name one); long-form environments with `production`, `access`, `read_only: {hosts, allow,
  mocks}`; read-only enforced in every persona context (writes mocked or stopped, production fail-closed on every host,
  keepalive / beacon / fetchLater / SharedWorker / service-worker paths covered), writing hooks refused, production
  writes only with `access: read-write` + `--allow-writes`, hosts of read-only environments protected from any run;
  access mode and writes in run.json / timeline / run summary / review; `clock:` (Date-only: the product's timers and
  animations stay real — a deviation from "Playwright clock API", whose fake timers slowed product animations). The
  Studio app confirmation is phase 4 (BL-66). Every acceptance item checked on the Mac.

### L1.8 — Sandbox mode (L) — after L1.7, before L3.1
- **Scope:** `sandbox.yaml` manifest (docker-compose | process), `retake sandbox init|up|down|reset|status|logs`,
  health checks, seed and snapshot reset, demo accounts bound to personas (automated login), mailbox, sandbox exposed
  as an environment with display URLs, `retake run --sandbox`; the fixture shipped as a sandbox example
  (R-SBX-01..06).
- **Acceptance:** two consecutive `retake run --sandbox` takes produce the same data on screen; docker-compose path
  verified where a Docker daemon is available (else on the Mac).
- **Done (2026-10-14):** `sandbox.yaml` (version 1; process | docker-compose services with pages, display URLs and
  health; seed steps; reset by reseed or Postgres template-clone snapshot; demo accounts as personas with automated
  login; mailbox; databases), declared per environment in project.yaml; new package `@retake/sandbox`; `retake
  sandbox init | up | down | reset | status | logs`; `retake run --sandbox` (every take from the same state); the
  fixture as a process and a Docker sandbox (Mailpit through an SMTP relay). Two takes with a mutation between them
  read the same data on both providers (Mac, OrbStack). Data-safety rules (loopback only, owned databases and
  mailboxes, compose folder and port ownership, pid + start + boot identity) reviewed and tested.

### L2.1 — Phase-2 contracts in core (S)
- **Scope:** template `brand` + `components` map with legacy mapping (R-THM-01..03); scenario additions — intro/outro/
  interstitial component refs, `card` entries, `frame` as a layout id, step `overlay` (R-SCN2-01..06, R-SCN-07/08);
  overlay target bbox recorded by the runner; title/intro/outro carried into timeline.json (R-SCN-03); project frame
  default (R-PROJ-06); JSON Schemas regenerated.
- **Acceptance:** schema/validation tests with line numbers; fixture scenarios still valid; runner test for overlay bbox.
- **Done:** `ComponentKind`/`COMPONENT_KINDS`/`ComponentRef` live in core (re-exported by components); template `brand`
  + `components` and `resolveThemeComponents` (legacy mapping, warning on contradictions); scenario intro/outro/
  interstitial components, `card` entries, `frame` ids (`FrameSpec`), step `overlay`; runner records cards, overlay
  anchors measured at the end of the step (camera too, tested on the SPEC scroll example) and `timeline.video`;
  starter templates declare brand + components; quote fixture shows a card and an overlay (captured, bbox checked on
  the frame); JSON Schemas regenerated. 345 tests pass (6 Postgres tests skipped).

### L2.2 — Components package foundation (M)
- **Scope:** `@retake/components`: manifest schema + validation, registry (workspace → built-in, did-you-mean,
  resolve with params defaults), `validateComponent` (schema, entry, params schema, preview samples, esbuild compile),
  `createComponent` scaffolds per kind, `themeTokens`, `kit` helpers (fades/rises/stagger, easing presets, fitText,
  Logo, Wordmark, background) (R-CMP-02..11, R-REG-01..12, R-DEC-03, R-CMT-01 type).
- **Acceptance:** unit tests; a scaffolded component validates and compiles.
- **Done:** `component.yaml` strict zod schema + `parseManifest` (positioned issues, id = folder, semver, slot
  sources, params JSON-Schema subset + defaults, preview samples, layout geometry in the design space) and
  `schema/component.schema.json` (`gen:schema`); `loadComponentRegistry` (retake.yaml `components_dir` → built-in
  `library/`, override warning, invalid folders as notices; `list`/`get` with did-you-mean/`resolve` with params
  defaults + validation/`resolveTheme`); `validateComponent` (manifest, entry, esbuild in-memory compile with an
  import allow-list, misspelt named imports of react/remotion/kit, Math.random/Date/network scan); 8 per-kind
  scaffolds (`scaffolds/<kind>/`, theme-driven, unit-sized, deterministic — rendered with Remotion in the editorial
  and motion themes and inspected) + `createComponent`; `themeTokens`; `fillSlots`; the kit
  (`@retake/components/kit`: easing, frame-driven motion, fitText with balanced lines and ellipsis, Background,
  Logo, Wordmark, SafeArea, FitText, colour helpers); `retake components list|validate|create`; FrameComment type in
  core. R-ARCH-03 (remaining packages) moved to L5.3, the last lot that adds one.

### L2.3 — Edit planner (M)
- **Scope:** `planEdit` pure + deterministic: segment order and component precedence, scene source ranges, transitions
  vs contiguous joins, interstitial backdrop, speeds with ramps, 1× protected spans, idle trims, camera zooms (clamp,
  focus, easing, no reset at same-page joins, view clamping), captions, overlays positioning, provenance StepSpans,
  time map, overrides, notes/warnings (R-PLN-*, R-ED-02..09/15/22, R-THM-05).
- **Acceptance:** unit tests on the two real fixture timelines (copied as test fixtures) + synthetic edge cases.
- **Done:** `planEdit` (packages/editor/src/plan.ts, exported by `src/index.ts`), pure and deterministic: segments
  intro → scenes/cards/interstitials → outro; components by precedence (segment id override → kind override →
  scenario → theme via `registry.resolveTheme` → built-in default; unresolvable → next candidate with a warning, none →
  `missing` stand-in) with `fillSlots`; clips from the end of the page load (exact CFR `srcFrames`); contiguous
  same-page scenes planned as one "run" (no transition, camera continues); theme transitions elsewhere (crossfade with
  held last frame, fade-black halves, cut); interstitial backdrop; speeds (scene, `overrides.speeds`, step) with 1×
  protected spans (still, holds, ±0.6 s marks) and 0.3 s ramps; idle trims outside protected spans (> 1.2 s → 0.4 s);
  camera zooms from step hints (max_zoom clamp + note, bbox → point → cursor focus, hint ease else theme zoom_ease
  over max(0.8 s, duration) of output, step_end/scene_end/N s hold, view clamped); captions (scene, step, cues never
  overlap); overlays with source-px anchors + `mapSourceRect`; StepSpans, markers, time map; layout geometry from the
  manifest fitted to the capture; 1920×1080 × scale and the 1080×1920 vertical variant with a smoothed reframe track;
  music; every EditOverrides field; notes/warnings. Additive plan-type fields (PlanTransition, clip cues/layout/src/
  speeds/trims/zooms/heldFrames, OverlayUse.anchor, PlanLayout.crop, `missing`, `assets` with `ds-asset:` URLs +
  `resolvePlanAssets`, `meta`). `retake plan <project> <run|latest>` (summary, `--json`, `--out`, `--theme`,
  `--frame`, `--vertical`); README "Editing". 49 new tests (45 planner on the real catalogue/quote timelines in
  `packages/editor/test/fixtures/` + synthetic cases, 4 CLI); 476 tests pass (6 Postgres tests skipped). R-ED-22 stays
  partial (`motion.default_zoom` unused: zooms only from explicit hints).

### L2.4 — Render pipeline (M)
- **Scope:** `DemoVideo` composition rendering a plan (segments, fades, Freeze+OffthreadVideo, camera transform,
  captions/overlays/brandmark slots), generated component registry module, bundle cache, local asset server,
  `renderVideo` / `renderStill` / `listRenders`, RenderRecord + versioned names, silent audio, progress/abort/
  concurrency, `retake render` (R-RND-*, R-ED-01/18/19/23/24/25, R-CLI2-01, R-PRJ-01, R-PROJ-10, R-TPL-04).
- **Acceptance:** catalogue fixture rendered end to end with placeholder components; frames inspected.
- **Done:** placeholder built-in library `packages/components/library/studio/*` (the 18 ids of the starter themes and
  the legacy mapping, theme-driven, tag `placeholder`, params the themes pass, layouts draw exactly their declared
  geometry; validated + rendered in both themes by `packages/components/test/library.test.ts`); compositions
  `DemoVideo` / `DemoVertical` (`packages/editor/src/remotion/`: segments, transition windows — crossfade overlap, dip
  split ⌊n/2⌋ —, fade envelope fallback, layout with the capture under the camera, captions in the caption area,
  overlays through layout + camera, brand mark drawn by the composition, interstitial backdrop, music bed, FontFace +
  delayRender, scaffold stand-ins for `missing`); the capture frame is an `OffthreadVideo` in a shifted `Sequence`, not
  `Freeze` (Remotion clamps a frozen position to the composition length — the first catalogue render showed a frame 3 s
  early at the "Awards" zoom; regression-tested with a colour-coded capture); generated registry module + bundle cache
  (`.retake/cache/remotion-<hash>/`); asset server (Range, CORS); `renderVideo` / `renderPlan` / `renderStill` /
  `listRenders` (RenderRecord, versions with locks, H.264 CRF 16 yuv420p BT.709 faststart, silent AAC, progress,
  AbortSignal, concurrency); `retake render` / `retake still`; README "Rendering". 513 tests pass (6 Postgres tests
  skipped). Fixture renders: catalogue 59.00 s in 3 m 38 s, quote 56.27 s in 2 m 59 s (concurrency 3, 4 CPUs); key
  frames inspected; R-PROJ-10 / R-PRJ-01 (review/ folder) moved to L2.6, R-TPL-04 (style_bias) to L2.5.

### L2.5 — Reference-look components (M)
- **Scope:** studio/intro-stack, outro-stack, layout-card, caption-below, interstitial-clock, transition-crossfade with
  the measured values of `docs/reference/look.md` (R-LIB-00/01/03/06/08/13/17, R-LOOK-01..22, R-THM-04/07,
  R-ED-11/16).
- **Acceptance:** stills compared with the reference measurements (positions within a few px); both themes
  (editorial, motion) render natively; Claude reviews the stills.
- **Done:** the six components rewritten (tag `reference-look`, 1.0.0; theme tokens only; text placed by its cap band
  with the new kit `fontMetrics` / `capTextLayout` / `<CapText>`; `biasMotion(style_bias)` for balanced/motion;
  wordmark = brand name in the display font without an image); layout geometry follows params through **geometry
  expressions** in component.yaml (params, `vars`, `aspect`; validated, evaluated by the planner per use, passed to the
  layout as `props.rects`) — layout-card width moves card + caption + brand mark; kit background "lighter at the top"
  fitted to the reference; editorial caption line 38 px; `renderStills` (one browser session); interstitial-plain
  `tone: paper` fixed for dark themes. Measured on real renders (`packages/editor/test/render-look.test.ts`: rule,
  card edges, caption, brand mark, logo rows, clock, texts within ≤ 3 px of look.md, motion at 0.4/1.0/1.3 s, width
  1400 on screen, half-size render, determinism); 540 tests pass (6 Postgres tests skipped). Fixture renders
  catalogue-v3 (59.00 s in 3 m 37 s) and quote-v3 (56.27 s in 2 m 58 s), compared side by side with the reference
  stills (notes in HANDOFF); R-LOOK-03/05 (review checks) moved to L2.6, R-LIB-00 to L2.7.

### L2.6 — Review package (M)
- **Scope:** `reviewRender`: contact sheets (paginated), per-scene sheets, key frames, output-time timeline, report.json
  + report.md, base64 thumbnails, every check of DESIGN-phase2 §3, diff vs previous render; `retake review`
  (R-REV-*, R-CLI2-02, R-GOAL-06); the look checks moved from L2.5: video 1–2 min / scenes 4–25 s, at most one slow
  zoom per video (R-LOOK-03/05).
- **Acceptance:** review of the L2.5 render; synthetic bad renders trigger each check.
- **Done:** `@retake/review` — `reviewRender({project, render: id|path|latest, scenario?, fps?, previous?,
  thumbnails?, thumbnail_px?, rules?, out?})` → ReviewResult; writes `review/<render-id>/` (swapped in atomically):
  `sheet_<fps>fps.jpg` (+ pages shared evenly, ≤ 6×10 tiles; timecode, frame, segment/step/marker/transition labels;
  tiles outlined where a finding points), `sheet_scene_<id>.jpg` (2 fps, scenes/cards/interstitials), key frames
  (markers, scene first/last fully visible frame, intro/outro hold), output-time `timeline.json` (segments with
  components, captions, markers, step spans, transitions, zooms, overlays, clicks on the output), `report.json`,
  `report.md`, `diff_<previous>.jpg`; JPEG thumbnails ≤ 1280 px as base64. One ffmpeg pass per video (render, capture,
  previous render), sharp for tiles/sheets/key frames. Checks: durations (video 1–2 min: info within ±25 %, warning
  beyond; scenes 4–25 s info, < 2 s warning), long scenes at ~1×, blank / near-uniform screens (screen rect, transitions
  excluded, capture frame consulted), blank / loading scene starts, screen changing during the opening still,
  `long-wait` (unchanging screen ≥ 3 s while the scenario waits), empty cards, caption/scene mismatch, caption overlaps,
  captions too long (kit `fitText` + the theme's real font files), caption under the brand mark / not visible / missing,
  text slots over `max_chars`, cursor off screen / hidden / outside the zoomed view at clicks, zoom count, slow zooms,
  zoom resets at same-page joins, camera jumps, transitions over clicks, render status / probe / missing components,
  diff with the previous render (durations, plan changes, visibly changed frames at the same segment offset).
  `retake review` (+ `--fps`, `--previous`/`--no-previous`, `--scenario`, `--strict`, `--json`) and `retake render
  --review`; README "Reviewing a render". Fixture reviews: quote-v3 clean (info: 56.3 s), catalogue-v3 one warning
  (`long-wait`: 3.8 s of skeleton placeholders in add-product) + info (59.0 s; zoom 1.3× in 2.2 s not "very slow").
  572 tests (566 pass, 6 Postgres tests skipped).

### L2.7 — Layouts & previews (M)
- **Scope:** layout-browser (real URL from the timeline), laptop, phone, **tablet**, raw; caption-overlay; card-title;
  intro/outro-minimal; interstitial-plain; overlay-callout, lower-third; transition-fade-black — replacing the L2.4
  placeholders; their geometry as expressions over their params where it should follow them (the mechanism exists
  since L2.5: layout-card); previews generated per theme
  (R-LIB-02/04/05/07/09..12/14..16/18/19, R-ED-10/12/13/14, R-CMP-12/13/14); committed `preview.png` + README per
  component (all 18 existing included), `retake components preview`, staleness test.
- **Done:** the thirteen components rewritten in the reference family (1.0.0, no placeholder left; R-LIB-00): layouts
  browser (macOS window, real URL per frame from the clip's URL track, optional tabs, light/dark chrome), laptop
  (MacBook-style, CSS only), phone (iPhone-style: status bar + Dynamic Island above the capture, side buttons, caption
  beside), **tablet** (new: iPad-style, portrait with the caption beside / landscape with the caption below, from the
  capture aspect; frame style `tablet`), raw (edge to edge, caption over the bottom); caption-overlay (night-tone band
  over the capture, kicker + line, kit `captionBandBox` shared with the review), card-title, intro-/outro-minimal
  (`logo_only`), interstitial-plain (`tone`), overlay-callout (ring + pill + pointer, never off-screen: `placeCallout`
  property-tested), overlay-lower-third (inside the capture), transition-fade-black (black or night tone). Geometry
  expressions over params and `aspect` for every layout (device proportions clamped; a capture outside them is
  letterboxed with the theme background: `PlanLayout.display` / `LayoutRects.display`); captions and overlays receive
  the clip layout's `rects`; kit `cardShadow`, `deviceTones`, `SYSTEM_COLORS`, `addressParts`. Previews:
  `ComponentPreview` composition + `buildComponentPreview` (pure) + `renderComponentPreviews` (one bundle and browser,
  half-scale stills, ffmpeg palette when > 200 KB), neutral sample screens generated once from the fixture
  (`packages/components/preview/`, `scripts/preview-samples.mjs`), `retake components preview [id|--all] [--stale]
  [--workspace] [--theme] [--out]`, `create` renders the preview (`--no-preview`), committed preview.png +
  preview.json + README block for the 19 library components and 8 scaffolds, staleness test (source hash of manifest +
  entry + local imports). Also: the scene-cursor flake fixed at the root (the glide runs on a motion clock capped per
  tick: a loaded machine pauses the cursor, never makes it jump; fake-clock stall tests), the fixture shop made
  responsive (tablet 820 × 1180, phone 390 × 844: tabs nav, bottom-sheet dialogs, one-month calendar) with a
  `mobile-quote` scenario captured at phone size, `retake still --layout`, run lookup by exact scenario
  (`mobile-quote` is not a run of `quote`), a capture with zero frames now fails. Renders checked frame by frame:
  quote with browser / laptop / raw, mobile-quote with phone / tablet. 600 tests (594 pass, 6 Postgres tests skipped;
  the full suite green twice in a row).

### L2.8 — Variants & export (M)
- **Scope:** vertical 9:16 and square 1:1 with smoothed reframing on the cursor/targets, 4K from scale-2 captures,
  music bed with ducking, export formats mp4_1080p / mp4_4k / webm / vertical_9x16 / square / gif_preview,
  `retake export`; theme `default_zoom` for balanced/motion styles (R-ED-17/20/21/22, R-EXP-*, R-CLI2-03).
- **Done:** **square** variant (`geometry_square` manifest key + JSON schema, `variants: [landscape, vertical, square]`,
  `DemoSquare`, `--square`) next to vertical; every layout + the layout scaffold declare both formats (card / browser as
  tall as the format allows, a wider capture reframed to 4:5 / ≈ 4:3; devices keep their proportions; captions below or
  beside); **real reframing** (`camera.ts reframeTrack`): cursor (+ 0.4 s ahead) and step targets (0.5 s look-ahead),
  hard boxes for every click (widgets: each `data.clicks`) and overlay anchors, dead zone + re-centring, a calm start on
  the first step, critically damped zero-phase smoothing, then `corridorSmooth` (banded QP, critically damped repair:
  no ringing) so the cursor and the clicked target are never cut; crop ≥ 0.9 design px per CSS px; per run (never across
  a cut); the composition draws the crop (`object-fit: fill`), overlays map through it. Full-frame components use the
  kit `formatMetrics` (type ×1.2 in vertical) and captions wrap (`captionMaxLines`); caption-overlay bands go below the
  card in vertical / square. **4K**: the CDP screencast of headless Chromium (new and shell) and `captureScreenshot`
  stay at CSS size at deviceScaleFactor 2 (also with Emulation on the recorder session); `--force-device-scale-factor`
  at launch gives real 3840×2160 frames — kept (`scaleArgs`), measured ≈ 9.5–16 fps at 4K vs ≈ 45–58 fps at 1080p
  (captureScreenshot fallback: 5.6 fps), 2–3 fps under a backdrop-blur dialog; 4K render of a 1080p capture works
  with an upscaling warning. **Music bed**: `music: {file, volume, duck, loop}` / `--music`, planned plays (trim, or
  loops with equal-power 1 s seams; the track measured by renderVideo), smoothstep fades and ducking (× 0.5 under
  footage, base volume on intro/outro/cards), procedural test track `generateTestTrack`. **Export**: `exportRender` /
  `retake export` → `exports/<render-id>/` + manifest.json (1080p copy/scale, 4K copy/re-render, WebM VP9+Opus, GIF
  480 px 12 fps palette around the first marker, vertical / square re-rendered). **Theme default zoom** (R-ED-22,
  decision applied; the motion starter sets 1.12). Review: widget clicks one by one, `target-cut`,
  `cursor-outside-reframe`, `reframe-jump`, theme-zoom checks, a moving still compared on the capture. Previews
  regenerated. Tests: reframe.test.ts, planner-motion-music.test.ts, export-real.test.ts, review checks, runner scale-2
  capture, CLI export. Fixture renders quote-v9-vertical, quote-v10-square (motion theme), catalogue-v4 (music) and
  its six exports, frames inspected and reviewed (HANDOFF).

### L2.9 — Mails, notifications & documents (L)
- **Scope:** project `mailbox` (Mailpit or HTTP), `wait_for_email` capturing the message and an image of its HTML;
  `download` capturing files from download events or new-tab documents with the session, PDFs rasterised with pdf.js
  in Chromium; captured artefacts referenced by components (`email: <name>`, `document: <name>` or a project file);
  components `studio/notification` (5 styles, scenario-filled), `studio/mail-notification`, `studio/mail-view`,
  `studio/document-pdf`, `studio/phone-lockscreen` (stacked notifications), `studio/phone-home-badge`; capture of the
  product's web notifications; "tap to open" transition; fixture: sign-up with a confirmation email, a real quote PDF
  and a web notification (R-MAIL-*, R-DOC-*, R-NTF-*).
- **Acceptance:** a fixture scenario captures an email, a PDF and a web notification and renders each component;
  frames reviewed.
- **Done:** core `mailbox` (Mailpit or generic HTTP JSON, host in the allow-list — helpers moved to core `hosts.ts`),
  actions `wait_for_email` (baseline at run start, oldest new matching message, `artefacts/emails/<as>.json` + the HTML
  rendered sandboxed at 600 px × 2) and `download` (real click; download event or new tab fetched with the session;
  `artefacts/documents/<as>.<ext>`, PDFs rasterised with pdfjs-dist 5.4.296 in a clean Chromium at 2× A4 →
  `documents/<as>/page-<n>.png`); project files as documents; **web notifications** captured by the kit
  (`new Notification`, `showNotification`; permission granted, binding) → artefact + timeline event; `timeline.artefacts`.
  Slots `email:` / `document:` / `notification:` checked (unknown names with a suggestion) and resolved by the planner
  into a serialisable `media` prop (images as plan assets; warnings when a run lacks them). Components (kit
  `notifications.tsx`, `phone.tsx`): `studio/notification` (macos | windows | ios-banner | android | in-app),
  `studio/mail-notification`, `studio/mail-view`, `studio/document-pdf`, `studio/phone-lockscreen`,
  `studio/phone-home-badge`, `studio/transition-tap-open` (scene/card `transition: <component>`, anchor from the
  outgoing overlay or card via manifest `anchor` expressions) — previews committed. Fixture: sign-up + confirmation
  email in a built-in Mailpit-compatible API, real quote PDF (Chromium `page.pdf`), console web notification; scenario
  `signup` (new) and `quote` (download + document card + captured notification). Renders signup-v4 and quote-v13
  reviewed, frames of every new component inspected (HANDOFF).

### L2.10 — Tutorial overlays & story cards (L)
- **Scope:** automatic overlays from the timeline — keyboard shortcut, spotlight, numbered steps, typing loupe,
  chapter progress bar — and cards — key figure (animated counter; `capture_text` action), feature list, before/after
  wipe, testimonial, final CTA with QR code, animated chart from data/CSV (R-TUT-*, R-STO-*).
- **Acceptance:** each enabled on the fixture videos and reviewed in both themes.
- **Done:** core `tutorial` switches on scenario / scene / step (`true`, `false`, a mode, `{component?, params?}`; most
  specific wins; `progress` scenario-only), copied by the runner into the timeline (the editor never reads the
  scenario); action `capture_text: {target, as, pattern?}` → `text` artefact; runner records `type` timing + the
  focused field of a `type` without `into`, `press` keys. Planner (editor `tutorial.ts`, pure, `TUTORIAL_TIMING`):
  shortcut caps on the real key press, a spotlight per run of steps gliding from target to target (screen layer, under
  caption and overlays), badges beside clicked targets, one loupe gliding from field to field (rendered from the
  capture itself, ≥ 1.5 px per CSS px), a chapter bar between intro and outro; reframe keeps tutorial targets in view;
  what cannot be shown → plan warning + review `tutorial-skipped`. Story-card slot types `capture`, `frame` (mark,
  scene start / end, time, image file), `data` (CSV / TSV) and image files, read before planning (`planInputFiles`)
  and resolved into `media`. Components (kit `keys`, `figures`, `qr`, `icons`, `picture`, `place`):
  `studio/overlay-shortcut`, `overlay-spotlight`, `overlay-steps`, `overlay-loupe`, `overlay-progress`, `card-figure`,
  `card-features`, `card-before-after`, `card-testimonial`, `card-cta` (local QR encoder, module-for-module equal to
  the `qrcode` package, dev-only), `card-chart` — previews committed. Review: `tutorial-skipped`,
  `tutorial-target-cut`, `media-missing`; the opening still is compared on capture frames under an overlay or a caption
  over the screen. CLI `render --tutorial | --no-tutorial`. Fixture: `signup` with every tutorial overlay (⌘K search
  added to the shop), new `highlights` (every story card, `capture_text` of the proposal total, a CSV). Renders
  signup-v7 / v12 (editorial), signup-v8-vertical, signup-v11 (motion; v9–v10 had the key caps over the caption band,
  then over the lens → overlays get `avoid`, the loupe keeps one side), highlights-v1 (editorial), highlights-v2
  (motion): reviews clean, frames of every overlay and card looked at (HANDOFF).

### L2.11 — Multi-page capture: split screen & picture in picture (M)
- **Scope:** the runner records two pages on one clock (e.g. supplier + buyer, or desktop + mobile viewport); timeline
  tracks per page; scenario syntax for parallel pages; layouts `studio/layout-split` and `studio/layout-pip` planned
  and rendered in sync (R-MPC-*).
- **Done:** scenario `pages:` (map or list; environment pages, `open: "page:/path"`, viewport presets desktop / laptop /
  tablet / mobile or `{width, height, mobile?, touch?}`, labels, per-page `cursor`) and step `on: <page>`, validated
  with positions (core `pages.ts`, checks, schemas). Runner: every page of the scene recorded at the same time — one
  CDP screencast per page on the run's clock, each encoded on the shared CFR grid as `capture-<page>.mp4` (same frame
  count as `capture.mp4`); viewports emulated per page (persistent CDP session: device metrics, touch, mobile UA); one
  in-page cursor per page (only the acting page's moves; `pacing.page_switch_ms` pause, then a glide — no teleport);
  timeline `tracks[]`, `scenes[].pages`, `events[].page`; single-page scenes unchanged. Planner (`panes.ts`):
  `plan.tracks`, clip `panes` (per-pane fit, camera, reframe, URLs) on one time map, `acting`, PiP `inset` track
  (never over the main page's current or next target, glides between corners, grows while its page acts with the
  theme's emphasis), automatic split / pip, theme-dressed layouts, layout geometry `panes` / `inset` / `aspect2`;
  tutorial overlays on their page's pane; a caption band over the screen goes below a split; main-page overlays pass
  under the inset. Components `studio/layout-split`, `studio/layout-pip` (+ kit `panes.tsx`), previews committed.
  Carry-over polish: overlays keep clear of the current and next click targets (`clear` → `avoid`, caps' other row),
  the loupe cross-fades between fields instead of panning, review `overlay-covers-target`; per-pane review checks.
  Fixture: live list in the console and the shop's quotes (1 s poll, "New" pill), scenarios `live-quote` (split) and
  `phone-and-desktop` (pip) with step badges. **Review fixes** (code + video review): badges numbered in time order
  over both pages; the acting page from the scene's start; the inset glides after its own step, keeps its badges
  inside it, its caps / lens clear of the main page's targets, never grows into a caption band; an idle page's cursor
  rests near its centre (never under an inset); viewport mismatches validated with positions; `open` on a page id keeps
  the environment's base path; reframe: a wide target by its leading part, a leading-edge start, no pan for a resting
  cursor, idle panes settle on their page's heading; a click that navigates ends its spotlight run and badge (review
  `tutorial-stale-target`); the fixture shop's bell polls (both hand-offs live). Renders (runs
  20261012-073840-live-quote, 20261012-080444-phone-and-desktop): live-quote-v7 (editorial), v8 (motion),
  v9-vertical; phone-and-desktop-v9 (editorial), v10 (motion), v11-vertical; signup-v14 (motion) — reviewed (only the
  `video-length` warning; signup-v14 clean), frames at every acting switch, click, hand-off and overlay looked at
  (HANDOFF).

### L2.12 — Bring your own media & motion (M)
- **Scope:** any segment can be a user video/image file; transparent overlay videos (ProRes 4444 / WebM alpha); Lottie
  component (card/overlay); "bring your own motion" docs (files, Lottie, custom Remotion components, output of any
  Claude motion skill) (R-OWN-*). Templates are never mandatory.
- **Done:** `intro`, `outro`, `card`, `interstitial` take your own file — `{video | image | lottie, from, to, fit,
  background, volume, duration}` — and a theme can name files for its intro / outro / interstitial (no component is
  mandatory). Files are drawn by two built-in components usable as several kinds (manifest `kinds`, `props.as`):
  `studio/media` (video, image; `fit: auto` keeps a 16:9 file whole in the vertical variant) and `studio/lottie`
  (`@remotion/lottie` 4.0.534 + `lottie-web`, theme colours replacing the file's via `colors`), previews committed.
  Step `overlay` takes a file over the capture — `{video | image | lottie, at: step | start | click | mark:<name> |
  seconds, anchor: target | cursor | screen | corner… | rect, scale, duration, loop}` — mapped through layout, camera
  and reframe; ProRes 4444 and VP9-alpha videos composite (pixel test: no halo). Positioned validation with ffprobe
  (missing file, extension / container, codec, `from` / `to` past the end, overlay without alpha, volume on a silent
  file). Audio: the file's own sound at `volume`, a silent file stays silent, the music bed ducks under files with
  sound; the render record says `audio: files | music+files`. Docs `docs/BRING-YOUR-OWN-MOTION.md` (export settings
  for motion tools and Remotion, Lottie, workspace components — `retake components new` —, output of Claude motion /
  design skills), linked from the README. Fixture: generated media (`scripts/fixture-media.mjs`: Remotion renders,
  hand-written Lottie JSON, each < 300 KB) and scenario `own-media` (user intro video with sound, outro image, alpha
  burst on the clicked button, Lottie card, Lottie check overlay; 46 s). **Catalogue `long-wait` fixed at the root
  cause:** waiting (wait steps and the load pause before them) plays at up to 4× after its first 0.5 s, marked waits
  protect only the moment the state appears (R-OWN-05) — catalogue-v5 reviews clean. **Review fixes:** a file's own
  sound no longer dips and clicks where the next transition begins (its ramps from the video element's own frame, end
  ramp applied); the vertical / square reframe keeps a step overlay's real box over the time it really shows (`at`,
  its own length); a file at a corner moves to the nearest free corner when a variant's framing would put it over the
  step's target (plan note; the review's `overlay-covers-target` now measures user files); a kind-wide overlay
  override keeps user files; a missing file is not a plan asset; `trim_idle: false` restores a marked wait's whole
  1× window. Renders (run 20261012-093815-own-media): own-media-v6 (editorial + music), v7 (motion + music),
  v8-vertical; catalogue-v5 (run 20261012-093047-catalogue) — all reviewed clean; frames at every segment boundary,
  inside the intro / outro, during the alpha burst (full-resolution crops) and the Lottie card / overlay looked at,
  intro audio measured sample by sample against the source (HANDOFF).

### L2.13 — Raw capture export for editors (M)
- **Scope:** `retake export-capture` / `run --raw`: clean clip per scene (loads cut), MP4 HQ or ProRes 422 HQ, 30/60 fps;
  cursor baked / absent + cursor & clicks as data / separate transparent cursor layer; markers as FCPXML, EDL, OTIO,
  CSV/JSON; package manifest (R-RAW-*). Use case: script and film with Retake, edit in another tool.
- **Done:** `retake export-capture <project> <run|latest>` and `retake run … --raw` (runner-web `src/raw/`,
  `exportCapture`) → `exports/<run>-raw-<format><fps>-<cursor>/`: one clip per scene (per page of a multi-page scene,
  on the same frames), from the scene's still (page loads never in a clip), the loading inside scenes cut (a run of
  waits that really waited, from just after the press — or its URL change — to the awaited state painted, paced on the
  capture's own frame interval; never a result, hold, mark or still), real time otherwise; MP4 (H.264 high, CRF 14,
  yuv420p, faststart) or ProRes 422 HQ (prores_ks profile 3, yuv422p10le), 30 or 60 fps CFR from the screencast's own
  frame timing (never interpolated), encoded once from the captured frames, each clip's start timecode = its place on
  the sequence; optional `selects` file. Cursor: `baked`; `none` (new runner option `hideCursor` / `run --raw --cursor
  none|layer`: the kit draws nothing, real input and the track unchanged, `capture.cursor: hidden`); `layer` (a
  transparent ProRes 4444 / VP9-alpha video per clip drawn from an atlas the kit's own look renders in Chromium, frame
  by frame from the cursor track). The kit now reports what its cursor draws (icon, press, ripple → timeline
  `cursor_effects`); cursor and clicks as JSON / CSV in every mode. Markers (scenes, steps, marks, captions, cuts) as
  FCPXML 1.10, CMX 3600 with locators, OpenTimelineIO and CSV / JSON; `manifest.json` + `README.md`. project.yaml
  `raw` defaults. Packages checked with ffprobe (counted frames, codec, profile, pix_fmt, fps, timecode) against the
  manifest and every marker file, with OpenTimelineIO 0.18.1 (otio_json, cmx_3600, fcpx_xml adapters) and frames
  looked at (clip starts / ends, both sides of every cut, the layer composited over the cursorless and the baked
  clips) — HANDOFF lists the runs and packages. Real-NLE imports are for the Mac (L1.5 / R-RAW-06). **Review
  fixes:** a cut starts after the step's last press (a type's typing and Enter, a select's option click are never
  cut), resumes on a frame painted after the awaited state at any export rate, and is not made when the scene ends on
  that state (loading kept, note); markers at a scene's very end are kept; WebM cursor layers (no timecode) are
  referenced from 0 in the OTIO and left out of the FCPXML; OTIO media URLs are `file://`; `run --raw --json` stays
  JSON lines; all packages re-exported and re-validated.

### L2.14 — Phase 2 acceptance (S)
- **Scope:** render catalogue + quote with the editorial theme, clean review, contact-sheet review by Claude, switch a
  component and the theme without touching the scenario (R-ACC2-*, R-GOAL-05, R-LES-10, R-CMP-01); one video with a user intro file and an alpha overlay; one raw export
  imported checks (FCPXML/OTIO validate); README update.
- **Mac handoff:** root `CLAUDE.md` (points to `docs/HANDOFF.md`, working agreement, commands); HANDOFF gains
  "Mac setup" (Node ≥ 22, pnpm, ffmpeg, Chromium for playwright-core, Docker later, Xcode for phase 5) and "First
  local session" (L1.5 checklist first); every helper used in the cloud session lives in the repo; branch ready to
  merge.
- **Done** (`docs/ACCEPTANCE-phase2.md`): fresh captures of catalogue and quote; catalogue-v7 and quote-v17 (editorial)
  review clean; the same quote capture re-rendered with `--theme motion` (quote-v18) and with one component switched,
  `--frame studio/layout-laptop` (quote-v19, the review's diff names only the layout), both clean, no scenario,
  project or template edited; contact sheets, scene sheets and key frames read by Claude against the reference look —
  two fixes: marker key frames now show the marked step done (plan markers `done`, `markDoneAt`), and the
  composition's own fade envelope with a hard-coded black veil is gone (every fade is a transition component; R-CMP-01
  audit with the theme background and the brand mark as documented exceptions); own-media-v9 (user intro video,
  alpha overlay, Lottie, music) clean; the raw export of the fresh quote run validated by the new
  `scripts/validate-raw.py` (OpenTimelineIO read-back). Mac handoff: root `CLAUDE.md`, HANDOFF "State" / "Mac setup" /
  "First local session" / cloud notes as a subsection, MACOS-CHECKLIST on `main`, BACKLOG maintained by hand (BL-54
  from the review), README phase status. **Phase 2 is done**; next: L1.5 on the Mac.

### L5.1 — Fixes found by the macOS verification pass (S)
- **Goal:** fix what the L1.5 pass found outside capture smoothness (that part is L1.3).
- **Scope** (`node scripts/requirements.mjs --lot L5.1`): the CLI refuses Node < 22 with a clear message (R-MAC-03:
  from a folder whose default Node was 10 it failed with a syntax error); a new workspace finds the starter templates
  (R-MAC-04); an unresolved keychain reference fails with one clean line (R-MAC-05); the automatic scene rest point stays
  inside the first target's dialog and near its click point (R-MAC-06: the quote delivery scene glides out of its
  dialog and back); decide how a continuing scene starts — keep the cursor or glide next to the first target —
  and align DESIGN §3.3 with the field rule (R-MAC-07); an unannounced popup is still detected when it opens late under
  load (R-MAC-08); `retake doctor` checks ffmpeg ≥ 5.1 (R-MAC-09).
- **Acceptance:** tests per item; quote re-captured on the Mac with the delivery scene's cursor resting beside the
  field inside the dialog; the CLI run from a folder on Node 18 prints the version message.
- **Packages:** cli, core, runner-web (kit restNear, scene-cursor, click), hooks.
- **Done (2026-10-12):** all seven items, with tests; quote and catalogue re-captured on the Mac (the request scene
  now glides to rest next to "Request a quote", the delivery scene rests between two selects inside its dialog, 72 px
  from the field's click point); the CLI's message checked on real Node.js 10, 16, 18 and 20.

### L3.1 — Engine API, job runner, storage abstraction, MCP server skeleton (L)
- **Goal:** Claude drives the capture half of the loop through MCP; the CLI and the MCP server call one engine API.
- **Scope:** new package `@retake/engine` (workspace / project loading, run execution, hooks, sign-in and sandbox
  code moved out of the CLI; typed `EngineError` at the MCP / worker boundary; a local storage interface); jobs
  (serialisable zod payloads with slugs, refs and sha256 — never secrets or paths — in
  `<workspace>/.retake/jobs/`, one writer per file, cancel markers, `interrupted` derived; a detached `retake
  worker` per workspace under one `worker.lock`, one job at a time); `retake mcp` over stdio with the official SDK
  (pinned, one module) and `--print-config`; 23 tools (engine, projects, scenarios, runs, jobs, hooks / env reset, auth,
  sandbox); human approvals by MCP elicitation, fingerprinted and signed; `retake jobs`; history; the ADR-1 amendment.
  Moved out: MCP HTTP transport and the engine's HTTP API, the SQLite index (L4.1); render / review / export tools
  (L3.2).
- **Acceptance:** an MCP client runs the loop on the fixture (list, validate, dry run, capture, capture with an approval,
  cancel, a killed worker → `interrupted`, env reset); nothing destructive, shell, secret, outside-project file or
  production write happens through MCP without a human; a live Claude Code session (MACOS-CHECKLIST 12c, the user).
- **Done (2026-10-17):** all of the above, automated with the SDK client over stdio on a copy of the fixture (quote
  and catalogue captured, approval answered, cancel, `kill -9` of the worker, env reset, auth_login auto, sandbox up /
  reset). Two reviewers found 16 issues, five of them safety holes (secrets through `{{env:}}` in agent-written
  scenarios, files outside the project, production bypassed by a cloned project, unapproved destructive rollbacks, a
  form hiding rollbacks) — all fixed and mutation-tested. The live Claude Code run is the user's checklist step 12c.

### L3.2 — MCP render / review / export + theme & component tools (M)
- **Goal:** Claude finishes the loop through MCP: plan, render, review with images, export, browse and preview themes
  and components — every long task a job of the L3.1 worker, nothing that lets an agent run code or read files outside
  the project.
- **Done (2026-10-17):** job kinds render / review / export / preview; 36 tools (plan_preview, render, render_status,
  review, review_get with contact sheets as image blocks — at most 4 images / 1.5 MB, text in images is data —,
  export, template_list / template_preview, component_list / get / validate / preview / create scaffold-only);
  `planRun` gates under trust `mcp` (every file a render reads is a project, run or theme file, checked before reading;
  Lottie from agent-writable folders refused as code; theme by name); a network guard for worker renders and previews
  (CDP Fetch allow-list, Remotion `/proxy` and media downloads checked, a CSP against WebSocket — 20 bypass vectors
  tested); previews only into `.retake/previews/`. No tool writes component code, themes or project.yaml (L3.5 /
  L3.7). Acceptance automated over the MCP client on the fixture (capture, editorial render, clean review, motion +
  laptop layout, export to three formats); a reviewer's 5 findings fixed (a case trick on macOS paths, report text
  outside `untrusted`). Live Claude Code run: MACOS-CHECKLIST 12d (the user). Cut to BL-72: `still` tool, `render_list`,
  image-cap tuning, a guard for CLI renders, Remotion's bundle server bound on all interfaces.

### L3.3 — Authoring: page_inspect + scenario_from_script (M)
- **Goal:** Claude writes scenarios itself with facts about the real pages; the tool makes no model call (user
  decision, 2026-10-18).
- **Done (2026-10-18):** `page_inspect` (a worker job, dry-run semantics with the persona's session, optional replay of
  a scenario up to a step or a failed step) returns the page's interactive elements with verified targets in the
  scenario language (unique and round-tripped through the real resolver; ambiguous ones fall back to scoped or nth,
  flagged fragile), the model's own targets checked, and a numbered screenshot; only the environment's own origins
  (checked on every read; foreign navigations stopped); page text only under `untrusted`; no field values; inspections
  kept in `.retake/inspect/`. `retake inspect [--json]`. `scenario_from_script`: a deterministic aid turning a
  timecoded Markdown table (EN / FR headers) into an outline and a draft that validates — never the start of the main
  path (inspect → Claude writes → validate → save → inspect with `until` → run_dry). Acceptance in `test:slow`: the
  scripted client writes its own steps from inspections and dry-runs them, no write reaches the fixture. A reviewer's
  9 findings fixed (the worst: a late JS redirect got a foreign page inspected). Live run: MACOS-CHECKLIST 12e.

### L3.4 — Recorder (`retake record`, scenario_record) (M)
- **Goal:** a person performs the flow in a real window; Retake turns it into a scenario draft that validates and
  dry-runs. Claude can start a recording through MCP but never drives it.
- **Done (2026-10-18):** a headed window on a copy of the persona's session (password manager and autofill off, real
  window size); the recorder and a passive kit run in an isolated world over CDP (invisible to the page, trusted events
  only, origin checked per event, sign-in pages and other sites skipped); each action becomes a step with a verified
  target at pointerdown (click, type with `into`, press, select, pick, menu with confirm, drop_file, scroll, wait_for
  what appeared, scenes at page changes); secrets never recorded (sticky per-field classification, in-page memory of
  secret values, tokens pasted or dropped, OTP, card, typed URLs masked) and replaced by `{{vars.<kind>_N}}`; a draft
  saved when the name is free, then a headless check replay up to the step before the first write that went through.
  `retake record` (CLI, primary path), the `record` job and MCP `scenario_record` (39 tools). Two reviews (secrets,
  isolation, writes to another host, issue positions) fixed with mutation-checked tests. Cut to BL-74: tabs / popups /
  frames, holds, alternatives, date / drag / hover mapping. A real person's recording: MACOS-CHECKLIST 12f.

### L3.5 — Themes from brand inputs and from a site URL (M)
- **Goal:** Claude makes a new workspace theme from a brand's logo, colours and fonts — files the human put in the
  workspace, or a draft taken from the brand's public website — previews it and renders with it; the palette is
  derived deterministically (no model call), an existing theme is never edited and a site's font files never copied.
- **Done (2026-10-19):** `template_create_from_brand` / `retake theme create` (sources checked: workspace files outside
  agent-writable folders, strict SVG scan, raster and font header checks, fonts renamed by weight, licence notes in
  LICENSES.md; palette from the accent with contrast checks, derived colours lifted and reported, the accent only
  suggested; a new lower-case name never a starter's or an existing folder's; temp folder + rename, provenance hashes,
  `replace` only of an unchanged tool-made theme); `template_from_site` / `retake theme from-site` (a worker job after a
  signed human approval of the exact URL; a clean Chromium whose only network is a local CONNECT proxy — public
  addresses only, the checked address connected, redirects re-checked —, escapes closed: WebSocket, WebRTC, service /
  shared workers, fetchLater; colours by role with contrast, font names, logo candidates as PNG `site:` refs, a
  screenshot; page text under `untrusted`). 41 MCP tools. Acceptance in `test:slow`: site draft → theme → preview →
  fixture quote render reviewed clean, frames looked at. Two independent reviews (network / SSRF; theme writes, docs,
  tests): 21 findings fixed with mutation-checked tests. R-DEC-04 stays partial (theme editor, R-UI-07). Cuts: BL-75.
  Live run: MACOS-CHECKLIST 12g.

### L3.6 — Frame comments API (store, anchors, MCP tools) (S)
- **Goal:** a person comments a frame of a render; Claude reads the comment with enough context (anchor in the edit +
  the frame still) to adapt the scenario, re-capture, re-render, reply and resolve.
- **Done (2026-10-19):** `retake comment add | list | reply | resolve | reopen` (only people create or reopen);
  one file per thread (`comments/<scenario>/c_<ULID>.json`), append-only entries under a lock, status derived, the
  render snapshot kept; anchor from the render's plan (segment, kind, component, scene, step, step fingerprint,
  marker, overlays, caption / screen / brand-mark area), the planner now records the marked step; a still with the
  region outlined in `.retake/comments/`; MCP `comments_list` (still as an image, text under `untrusted`, size
  caps), `comment_reply`, `comment_resolve` (if_match, same variant) — 44 tools. Acceptance in `test:slow`. Two
  independent reviews fixed with mutation-checked tests. Cuts: BL-76. Live run: MACOS-CHECKLIST 12h.

### L3.7 — Claude skills (scenario, theme, component) + plugin packaging (S)
- **Goal:** Claude gets the Retake loops as skills, installed with the MCP server as one Claude Code plugin.
- **Done (2026-10-20):** `skills/` is the plugin root: three skills (scenario authoring with inspect / record / script
  aid / frame comments; theme from brand files or an approved site; component scaffold → preview in the user's theme →
  validate) each with a strict Rules block (refusals and approvals final, never the `retake` CLI through the shell, no
  passwords, untrusted text stays data); `.mcp.json` launching `retake mcp` from install values; a local marketplace;
  `mcp --print-config` prints the install lines (`--scope local`). Component scaffolds import renderer primitives
  through the kit. A deterministic lint checks every tool call, argument and command the skills mention; gated tests
  install the plugin in a scratch Claude Code config and see the server connected. One independent review fixed with
  mutation-checked tests. Cuts: BL-77. Live run: MACOS-CHECKLIST 12i.

### L3.8 — Phase 3 acceptance (Claude drives the whole loop through MCP) (M)
- **Goal:** prove that Claude can drive the whole phase-3 loop through MCP with no human step but approvals.
- **Done (2026-10-20):** `packages/mcp/test/phase3-acceptance.test.ts` in `test:slow` (docs/ACCEPTANCE-phase3.md): a
  scripted MCP client following the skills, on an empty workspace and the fixture — project from a README, scenario from
  a timecoded script and page inspections, dry run with no product write, theme from brand files, intro component with
  two code iterations, capture, render (64 s) and clean review, then a person's frame comment answered by a scenario
  change, a re-capture, a render, a review, a reply and a resolve; zero approval requests. Found and fixed: a render
  shows the run as captured, so a scenario change now warns and every text says re-capture. One review fixed with
  mutation-checked tests (incl. a full-suite hang in the inspect path, now bounded). R-ACC3-01..06 partial until the live
  run MACOS-CHECKLIST 12j.

### L4.1 — Studio app shell on the engine API (`retake ui`), projects, README editor (M)
- **Goal:** a local web app on the same engine as the CLI and MCP, starting with the projects and their README.
- **Done (2026-10-23):** `retake ui` (packages/ui) on 127.0.0.1 behind one HTTP gate (Host, Origin / Sec-Fetch-Site,
  per-launch token reached through a one-time code, body caps, strict CSP); Projects screen, project page, README editor
  (conflict and changed-on-disk flows, line endings kept), activity and search on a SQLite index rebuilt from files,
  live updates over one stream per browser; `retake mcp --http` (same 44 tools over Streamable HTTP, stable token,
  browsers refused, approvals). Reads never follow a link out of a project. Two independent reviews fixed with
  mutation-checked tests. R-PRJ-02 partial (the queue stays in files per ADR-2), R-DEC-07 partial until L5.2. Cuts:
  BL-79. Live checks: MACOS-CHECKLIST 13a.

### L4.2 — Scenario as blocks (read) with run thumbnails (M)
- **Goal:** read a scenario in the Studio as scenes and steps, each with its real picture from the last run.
- **Done (2026-10-24):** the scenario screen: scenes as cards (pages, URLs, caption, speed, layout, duration), steps as
  rows (action badge, plain-words target, chips), hooks strip, read-only inspector and YAML tab; each step's picture
  from the last dry run or capture (kept frames or the video, memory only, matched to today's steps by step identity);
  Dry run / Capture / Cancel from the screen with blockers shown before any click; the Studio starts a worker with a
  cleaned environment. Two independent reviews fixed with mutation-checked tests. R-UI-15 partial ("Open timeline" is
  L4.5). Cuts: BL-80. Live checks: MACOS-CHECKLIST 13b.

### L5.5 – L5.8 — Field feedback 1 (decided 2026-10-26, before L4.3)
The first real use (`docs/FIELD-FEEDBACK-1.md`: triage, decisions and the performance measurements) opened four lots,
done before L4.3 resumes. L5.5 and L5.6 touch different packages and run in parallel; then L5.7, then L5.8. What the
field asked beyond them is in `docs/BACKLOG.md` (BL-81 – BL-89).

- **L5.5 — Edit without re-capture (M).** Goal: a change that does not touch the browser renders on the existing take.
  Scope (`--lot L5.5`): a filmed-part fingerprint replaces the whole-file comparison of L3.8 (R-FLD-01, R-FLD-02);
  card durations from their text and a review warning (R-FLD-03); `mail-view` without scroll by default (R-FLD-04);
  `target_length` per scenario (R-FLD-05); a document shown before what produces it (R-FLD-06). Acceptance: on the
  fixture, change a caption, a card's text and duration, the card order and an overlay, render on the same run with no
  `scenario_changed`; change a step and see it reported. Packages: core, editor, engine, review, cli, mcp, components,
  skills.
  - **Done (2026-10-26):** core `filmedChanges` / `scenarioSinceRun` (the filmed part) and `replanEdit` (today's edit on
    the take's timeline; `end_point` recorded per step); planRun / CLI / engine / MCP / Studio report a filmed change
    with its parts, an edit-only change re-plans on the run; edit sha256 on render records, jobs and exports;
    text-based card durations + `card-too-short`; mail-view `scroll: none`; `target_length`; `artefact-before-step`.
    Fixture acceptance on one `quote` take (renders v2 / v3 on the same run, a filmed change reported). Cuts: BL-90,
    BL-91.
- **L5.6 — Capture reliability (M).** Goal: a take fails early, loudly and completely, never silently wrong. Scope
  (`--lot L5.6`): R-FLD-10 – R-FLD-16. Acceptance: fixture cases for each (a field below the fold in a scrolling
  dialog, a dead button, a flaky download, a mail to another address, two renamed labels in one scene). Packages:
  runner-web, core, hooks, components (mail-view label), mcp / cli result output.
  **Done (2026-10-26):** the field's silent wrong `type` reproduced on a new fixture page (Pro forma invoices) with the
  old runner — the target resolved to a field behind the modal dialog — and fixed (matches behind a modal dropped;
  `type` scrolls the field in its own container, waits for its box to settle, checks the focus before typing and the
  value after); every missing target of a scene in one error; dead clicks warned at once with a screenshot and
  `retry_click`; download retries; `defaults.timeout_s`; persona `email`, `to: persona:<name>`, mailbox diagnostics
  and the mail-view label; `optional_failures` and `capture.step_shots`. Fixture cases in
  `packages/cli/test/reliability-fixture.test.ts`; capture + render of the fixture `proforma` scenario looked at.
  Follow-ups BL-92 – BL-94.
- **L5.7 — Capture performance and disk (M).** Goal: a take costs under a core with the limiter on, ends without a
  long encode and weighs tens of MB. Scope (`--lot L5.7`): R-FLD-20 – R-FLD-28, starting from the measurements in
  `docs/FIELD-FEEDBACK-1.md`. Acceptance: the same sampler on fixture `quote` before / after, frames looked at, the
  edit still frame-accurate. Packages: runner-web, editor, review, cli, engine, mcp.
- **L5.8 — Environment, off-camera actions, MCP ergonomics (M).** Goal: no hand-made reset script or side script
  polling the database. Scope (`--lot L5.8`): R-FLD-30 – R-FLD-34. Acceptance: a fixture scenario with a `hook:` step
  mid-take cut from the render; `doctor` pointing to a sandbox; compact MCP outputs measured in tokens. Packages:
  runner-web, hooks, sandbox, core, mcp, skills, cli.
  **Done (2026-10-26):** named hooks (`hooks:` of a scenario or project.yaml) run by `hook: <name>` steps during the
  take (hooks phase `step`: approved like setup hooks, rollbacks journaled, the step's span cut from the edit and the
  raw export); scene `offscreen: true` (played, not shown; an edit value); both in the filmed part / edit re-plan and
  the Studio blocks (palette, badge, named hooks read-only). A page pre-flight before every take; a docker-compose
  sandbox's `.env` (`compose.env_file`) passed to every compose command with its names left out of the shell's
  environment (checked on the real `docker compose`), a "stage" recipe; `doctor`, `project_get`, the MCP instructions
  and the scenario skill point to sandboxes. Compact `page_inspect` / `run_status` / `review` (`detail: "full"`), one-line
  JSON, `job_status` waits up to 600 s: page_inspect ≈ 13,300 → 2,200 tokens. Fixture scenario `off-camera`. Follow-ups
  BL-101 – BL-104. This lot closes the field-feedback group; what comes next is the user's choice (L4.4 per the
  roadmap).

### L4.3 — Blocks editing, two-way YAML, drag & drop (M)
- **Goal:** edit a scenario in the Studio, in blocks or as YAML, without losing the file's comments or formatting.
- **Done (2026-10-26, in a worktree, rebased on L5.6):** one verified write path (`scenario_edit`: text splices and yaml
  CST scalar edits, re-parsed and compared to the intended value); step moves by drag & drop or Alt+↑/↓, duplicates,
  deletes, inspector forms, a 15-action palette, undo / redo to the exact bytes, an editable YAML tab; hooks (and vars /
  env when hooks exist) never change from the Studio; a cross-process lock on every `if_match` write. Two independent
  reviews fixed with mutation-checked tests. Cuts: BL-95, BL-96. Live checks: MACOS-CHECKLIST 13c.

### L4.4 — Run screen: live headless preview, steps, log, pause/stop (M)
- **Goal:** watch a dry run or a capture as it happens, pause or stop it, and see the sessions it needs.
- **Done (2026-10-27, in a worktree, rebased on L5.7 and L5.8):** the Run screen (`#/p/<slug>/s/<name>/run[/<id>]`):
  the live picture of the acting page (worker loopback channel, memory only, only while watched; on for dry runs, off
  by default for captures: +15.6 % Chromium CPU measured), steps from the run's outline, log, Pause / Resume (captures
  too, the pause not filmed), Stop with teardown and rollbacks; the Sessions panel (headed Sign in, Cancel) and the
  capture's session confirmation. Two independent reviews fixed with mutation-checked tests. Cuts: BL-105, BL-106. Live
  checks: MACOS-CHECKLIST 13e.

### L4.5 — Edit/verify timeline: tracks, component switching, Remotion Player (L)
- **Goal:** see the edit on a timeline, preview it live without rendering, switch a segment's components in one click,
  then render and review from the same screen.
- **Done (2026-10-27, in a worktree):** the timeline screen (segment, caption, steps, camera, speed, marker and comment
  tracks; playhead and scrubber); a live preview by the Remotion Player in a sandboxed iframe on a second loopback origin
  (workspace components run only once allowed in the session); a segment inspector switching layout, caption component,
  speed and transition through a verified edit with undo; Render with the review inline, the queue, the report and the
  contact sheets in the UI. Two independent reviews fixed with mutation-checked tests (incl. a prerender escape closed
  three ways). Cuts: BL-107 – BL-110. Live checks: MACOS-CHECKLIST 13f.

### L4.6 — Frame comments UI (M)
- **Goal:** comment a render's exact frame from the Studio, read Claude's answer and its proposed change, preview it,
  apply it and re-render, and keep track of open and resolved threads.
- **Done (2026-10-27, in a worktree):** the Comments screen (server-made exact frames, a drawn or typed region, anchor
  chips, Open / Resolved / All, timeline pins and Comment button, a scenario-screen count); a `via: 'studio'` channel
  that creates, replies, resolves, reopens and applies; Claude's edit-only proposals on `comment_reply`, checked like a
  Studio edit without writing, shown as the server's diff (never cut), with Apply / Apply and re-render / Preview change
  / Undo through the verified write path. Two independent reviews fixed with mutation-checked tests. Cuts: BL-111,
  BL-112. Live checks: MACOS-CHECKLIST 13g.

### L4.7 — Component library (with animated previews) + theme editor screens (M)
- **Goal:** see every component in the project's (or any) theme, watch it move, pick theme defaults, and edit a theme
  with live previews — then use it in a scenario.
- **Done (2026-10-27, in a worktree):** the library screen (grid by kind, posters, animated GIF loops rendered on demand
  by the worker and cached, detail, Set as theme default, Create with Claude as a copyable prompt), the theme editor
  (brand, colours, type, motion, zoom, cursor, components per kind, live Intro / Clip / Outro in the sandboxed Player,
  undo, Copy to edit, New theme, site extractions with the command to copy) and a scenario `template` field ("Use in
  this scenario"). Two independent reviews fixed with mutation-checked tests (incl. an L4.5 hidden-import hole). Cuts:
  BL-113. Live checks: MACOS-CHECKLIST 13h.

### L4.8 — Record screen (M)
- **Goal:** record a scenario from the Studio by clicking through the site, pick robust targets, add quick inserts,
  and save it as a scenario.
- **Done (2026-10-28, in a worktree):** a real headed browser window opened by the worker with the Studio as control
  panel (no input forwarding: BL-25), a live draft, up to 3 verified alternative targets per action, quick inserts
  (hold, wait for, caption, mark, zoom) placed by row, Stop, the check replay, Save as a new scenario, Discard,
  read-only for recordings Claude or the CLI started. Two independent reviews fixed with mutation-checked tests; L3.4's
  generator pinned by golden drafts. Cuts: BL-118, BL-119. Live checks: MACOS-CHECKLIST 13i.

### L4.9 — Studio acceptance, accessibility pass (S)
- **Goal:** prove the Studio end to end and make it accessible, with one calm visual identity.
- **Done (2026-10-29, in a worktree):** a closed token palette with one blue accent, Geist / Geist Mono named locally
  (bundling: BL-120), contrast / overflow / focus / selected-state fixes, an in-repo accessibility checker and lints
  (no new dependency), two tours with a keyboard-only path in the default suite, and the R-ACC4-01 acceptance in the
  installed Chrome (projects → blocks → run → timeline switch with preview → render + review → comment → proposal
  applied). Two independent reviews fixed with mutation-checked rules. Cuts: BL-120 – BL-123. Live checks:
  MACOS-CHECKLIST 13j.

### L5.9 – L5.15 — Studio « Épure », the rename, captures first (decided 2026-10-29, after L5.2)
The founder validated a Studio redesign (BL-124: a dark, pro three-pane app following the system's appearance, the
pipeline Script · Shoot · Edit · Review as the navigation; the design canvas and every decision are linked there) and
the name Retake (no trademark or domain check: the tool is distributed locally). Order: **L5.2 → L5.2b → L5.9 → L5.10 →
L5.11 → L5.12 → L5.13 → L5.16 → L5.14 → L5.15 → L5.3 → L5.4**, so the phase 5 acceptance runs once, on the final UI in the
desktop app. Requirements are written when each lot starts (R-UI-02 is amended by BL-124: dark by default and
following the system, the Geist pair and the blue accent kept, a red reserved for recording).

- **L5.9 — Épure 1: foundations and the design system (M).** `docs/reference/studio-ui.md` (tokens, type scale
  13 / 15 / 20, pane anatomy, the components, the screens, exported from the canvas). **A design system for the Studio,
  in `packages/ui` (decided 2026-10-29):** one token file for both appearances (dark and light, the CSS custom
  properties generated from it); reusable, accessible React components — buttons (primary, secondary, destructive,
  record), icon button, segmented control, switch, text field, select, labelled field row, status mark (shape + word),
  toolbar, status bar, source list, inspector section, poster and frame card, timecode, one-line blocker with its
  action, sheet, menu, command palette, empty state, progress; the app shell (title bar with the centred mode switch,
  left browser, inspector, status bar with the actions) wired to the hooks L5.2 leaves (integrated title bar, menu-bar
  command table, system appearance). A gallery screen shows every component in both appearances; the L4.9 checker runs
  on it, and a source lint keeps screens on the kit (no ad-hoc button or colour). Built in-house on React (no new
  dependency unless a headless library proves needed for menus and popovers — decided when the lot starts); the Geist
  pair bundled (BL-120). Screens keep their content inside the new shell; L5.10 – L5.12 rebuild them from the kit
  only.
- **L5.10 — Épure 2: Project and Scenario (M).** The two reference screens of the canvas: productions as a poster grid
  with smart groups and an inspector; the scenario as a storyboard of real frames per scene, the step inspector, the
  YAML source.
- **L5.11 — Épure 3: Shoot (M).** Prepare a take (the checklist, a blocking hook in one line with Copy command), the
  live rehearsal or capture, the Record screen.
- **L5.12 — Épure 4: Edit, Review and the rest (M–L).** The timeline and live preview, frame comments with Claude's
  proposal, the review report and exports, the component library, the theme editor, the ⌘K palette, the confirmation
  sheets; the accessibility items of BL-122 that come with them (reduced motion; the dark appearance came in L5.9).
- **L5.13 — Rename to Retake (M).** Everything at once, no alias (decided 2026-10-29): the command (`retake`), package
  names, the MCP server's name, the skills and plugin, the docs, the desktop app's name and identifier (defined in one
  place by L5.2) and the "two takes" icon; the old command and the old names are gone after it.
- **L5.16 — The standalone app (L; decided 2026-10-29, right after the rename so it ships under the final name).** BL-36
  as a lot: one DMG installs everything on a new Mac (Apple Silicon), nothing else to install — Node and the engine
  (our packages only, no repository), the CLI (the app installs the command on the PATH, a launcher running the
  bundled Node), the MCP server (registered in Claude Code / Claude Desktop from the app at first run), Chromium for
  captures, the headless shell and Remotion's compositor for renders, ffmpeg / ffprobe (our own relocatable LGPL build
  with VideoToolbox, libvpx and ProRes — Homebrew's links Homebrew libraries and is GPL with x264; Remotion's has no
  filters). A first run (workspace, Retake home, screen and notification
  permissions, CLI and MCP offered). Developer ID signing of every embedded executable with the hardened runtime and
  the entitlements Node / Chromium need, notarisation, a DMG through Tauri's bundler, and a signed updater with its
  own feed (L5.14, L5.15 and later lots reach installed Macs as updates). The signing identity, notarisation
  credentials, updater key and feed URL come from the environment at release time, never from the repository.
  Needs from the user: approved downloads (ffmpeg sources), their own signing / notarisation run or an explicit go,
  where the updater feed lives.
- **L5.14 — Captures first (L).** BL-116 on the file queue (decided 2026-11-04: no new dependency; BL-117, pg-boss
  over an embedded Postgres, is parked): a capture runs first, heavy jobs wait for the takes or slow down during one.
- **L5.15 — Renders on the GPU (S).** BL-114: angle and VideoToolbox, a lighter concurrency, measured against today.

### L5.2 — Tauri desktop shell (macOS) (M)
- **Goal:** the Studio as a macOS app, with the same UI and no new trust surface.
- **Done (2026-10-29, in a worktree):** `apps/desktop` (Tauri 2.12.5, built offline, ad hoc signed, never installed by
  the tooling) supervising `retake ui --supervised` and opening its one-time URL in an incognito WKWebView window
  (navigation held to the Studio and Player origins, downloads cancelled, permissions denied, no IPC, the drag handler
  off), owned vs attached servers, graceful quit vs crash with no orphan, a minimal menu from one table, ready for
  L5.9 (title-bar switch, free shortcuts, no forced appearance). A preview-frame race found through the app fixed in
  the product. Two independent reviews fixed with mutation-checked tests. Cuts: BL-125. Live checks: MACOS-CHECKLIST 14a.

### L5.9 — Studio « Épure » 1: foundations and the design system (M)
- **Goal:** the redesign's foundations — tokens, a component kit, the new shell — with today's screens inside it.
- **Done (2026-10-29, in a worktree):** one token file for dark and light (dark by default, following the system; light
  identical to L4.9), Geist and Geist Mono bundled, a 23-component accessible kit built in-house, the shell with the
  centred mode switch, browser, inspector and status bar, the gallery `#/ui` in both appearances, the kit-only ratchet
  and contrast lints, the desktop View menu on the page's command table; docs/reference/studio-ui.md. The overlay title
  bar waits for a hand probe (BL-126). Two independent reviews fixed with mutation-checked tests. Cuts: BL-126, BL-127.
  Live checks: MACOS-CHECKLIST 14b.

### L5.10a — Studio « Épure » 2a: the project side (split from L5.10)
- **Goal:** the Project screen and the project's browser from the validated B32 design, without losing anything.
- **Done (2026-10-30, in a worktree):** `project_board` (a fast, path-free read of every scenario's state and poster),
  state words always a shape and a word, the browser (Productions with smart groups, Library, Locations, Cast, Project),
  Welcome, the Productions poster grid with search, sort, New scenario and inspectors; ProjectsScreen / ProjectPage
  replaced; two product races fixed (dialog focus return, a job the Studio could miss). Two independent reviews fixed with
  mutation-checked tests. Cuts: BL-128. L5.10b: the scenario storyboard, step inspector, scenes, YAML source, Location.

### L5.10b — Studio « Épure » 2b: the scenario side (split from L5.10)
- **Goal:** the Scenario screen from the validated B32 design — storyboard, inspectors, scenes, YAML source — without
  losing any editing capability.
- **Done (2026-11-02, in a worktree):** the storyboard of real frames per scene with one selection driving board,
  browser and inspectors, the step inspector (form, other ways to find it, modifiers), scene / card / hooks / video
  inspectors, a minimal take strip, Board · YAML and Location in the title bar, the YAML source with its File inspector;
  the verified write path and the 1,200-step budget unchanged. Two independent reviews fixed with mutation-checked
  tests. Cuts: BL-129.

### L5.11a — Studio « Épure » 3a: Shoot without the Record screen (split from L5.11)
- **Goal:** prepare a take, follow it live, and start / stop it from anywhere, from R4-ShootPrep / ShootLive / Confirm.
- **Done (2026-11-02, in a worktree):** Prepare's checklist with each blocker in one line and its Copy command, the live
  rehearsal or capture with Pause / Stop and its outcome, the status bar's Rehearse · Capture · Render · Stop on every
  screen through a command bus with priorities, the desktop Scenario menu, the Cast on the kit with the Sessions panel,
  the confirmation sheet, a smaller take strip; a fast read `scenario_actions` with blocker kinds; "Rehearse" in the UI.
  Two independent reviews fixed with mutation-checked tests. Cuts: BL-130. L5.11b: the Record screen in the shell.

### L5.11b — Studio « Épure » 3b: the Record screen (split from L5.11)
- **Goal:** the Record screen from R4-Record inside the shell, without losing any L4.8 capability.
- **Done (2026-11-02, in a worktree):** the start form, the Recordings group, the live recording (the draft as one tab
  stop, alternatives as a radio group, the Insert toolbar, the inspector with Stop / Save / Discard through a sheet),
  the status bar and ⌘. owned by the recording, the palette's Stop recording / Discard…; RecordScreen off the ratchet.
  Two independent reviews fixed with mutation-checked tests. Cuts: BL-131.

### L5.12a — Studio « Épure » 4a: Edit and the Review report (split from L5.12)
- **Goal:** Edit from R4-Edit and the Review report from R4-Review inside the shell, without losing any L4.5 – L4.7
  capability.
- **Done (2026-11-02, in a worktree):** the timeline, live preview and inspector on new kit pieces, Edit's own Render
  (refused on a proposal), Cancel and the version note; the Review report (contact sheets, checks by family, the selected
  check's frame, Show in Edit, the renders, Render again, Export video (MP4) through `review_export`, the raw capture as
  a command); the scenario's renders card on the kit; ratchet −294. Two independent reviews fixed with mutation-checked
  tests. Cuts: BL-132. Next: L5.12b, L5.12c, L5.12d.

### L5.12b — Studio « Épure » 4b: frame comments, Claude's proposal, README, ⌘K (split from L5.12)
- **Goal:** the Comments view from R4-Comments and the palette from R4-Palette inside the shell, without losing any
  L4.6 capability.
- **Done (2026-11-02, in a worktree):** the thread list, the frame and the composer, the thread and Claude's proposal (a
  code-safe kit DiffTable) in the inspector, the banner on Edit; one status line for both Review views; the README
  editor on the kit; the ⌘K palette with icons, groups and a legend, never writing; ratchet −339. Two independent
  reviews fixed with mutation-checked tests. Cuts: BL-133. Next: L5.12c, L5.12d.

### L5.12c — Studio « Épure » 4c: the Library and the theme editor (split from L5.12)
- **Goal:** the Library from R4-Library and the Themes list / theme editor from R4-Theme inside the shell, without
  losing any L4.7 capability.
- **Done (2026-11-03, in a worktree):** the poster grid with the selected card's inspector and the detail page on kit
  DataTables, Create / Set as default / copy-first as Sheets; the theme editor with one live preview and its fields on a
  kit ColorField; the Themes list and New theme form on the kit; ratchet −603. Two independent reviews fixed with
  mutation-checked tests. Cuts: BL-134. Next: L5.12d.

### L5.12d — Studio « Épure » 4d: the quit sheet, motion, the end of the legacy layer (split from L5.12)
- **Goal:** the desktop quit question in the page, reduced motion, and no legacy control or CSS left.
- **Done (2026-11-03, in a worktree):** the quit question as a kit Sheet asked by the shell and answered through the
  server's pipe (`desktop_answer`), the native alert as the fallback and for logout / restart; bits / main on the kit;
  app.css and the legacy tokens deleted, the ratchet at zero; the reduced-motion and className lints. Two independent
  reviews fixed with mutation-checked tests. Cuts: BL-135. L5.12 is done; next: L5.13.

### L5.13 — Rename to Retake (split in L5.13a, L5.13b)
- **Goal:** one name everywhere, no alias, and the "two takes" mark.
- **Done (2026-11-03, in a worktree):** L5.13a — the command `retake`, packages `@retake/*`, `RETAKE_*` variables, the
  home, workspace file and tool folders, MCP server / plugin / skills, the desktop app's name and identifier, Docker names,
  by a committed deterministic script; an existing installation told (CLI line, Studio note, MCP, doctor), never migrated;
  a guard test for leftovers. L5.13b — the mark in the Studio, the favicon and the desktop icons from one source. Two
  independent reviews per part fixed with mutation-checked tests. Cuts: BL-136. Next: L5.16.

### L5.16 — The standalone app (split in L5.16a – L5.16e)
- **Goal:** one app with everything inside, signed and notarised, a DMG, an updater, released from a tag.
- **Done (2026-11-04, in a worktree):** L5.16a — a relocatable engine and the staged tree with our own GPL ffmpeg.
  L5.16b — `pnpm desktop:bundle` / `desktop:release`: the app, its signing, verify and the DMG. L5.16c — the first run,
  the Set-up sheet (the command, Claude Code and Claude Desktop on a click), two copies said. L5.16d — the updater on a
  static feed of the person's own. L5.16e — releases by GitHub Actions (build without secrets, signing on a fresh
  runner), docs/RELEASING.md. Two independent reviews per part fixed with mutation-checked tests. Cuts: BL-137 – BL-145.
  L5.16f — the update feed on a GitHub release (no self-hosted host). The first tagged run is the person's
  (MACOS-CHECKLIST 15b). Next: L5.14.

### L5.14 — Captures first (split in L5.14a – L5.14b)
- **Goal:** a take never waits for, nor films beside, a render at full speed — on the file queue, no new dependency.
- **Done (2026-11-04, in a worktree):** L5.14a — job classes from the worker's own view (capture-side vs heavy), the
  workspace worker's two slots (captures inline, one heavy job in a job process of its own), per-user filming markers
  with a heartbeat and a 60-minute cap, background QoS on a running heavy job's whole tree during a take (chosen by a
  measured spike over a SIGSTOP), guarded signals and a recovery that proves a job process before signalling it, the
  CLI's wait (`--no-wait`). L5.14b — the hold said everywhere (Studio rows and status bar, MCP, `retake jobs`, doctor),
  a take's report notes takes beside it and slowed heavy work, rollback-journal entries signed for where they stand and
  replayed once, approvals bound to their job and workspace and used once, the job process given a digest of its claimed
  record, the measured acceptance from the Studio's own submits. Two independent reviews per part fixed with
  mutation-checked tests. Cuts: BL-146 – BL-151. Next: L5.15.

### L5.15 — Renders on the GPU, with a lighter load (S)
- **Goal:** renders cost less of the machine a take needs, measured against today.
- **Done (2026-11-05, in a worktree):** one render policy (editor `render/policy.ts`, core `render-settings.ts`):
  ANGLE (Metal) + VideoToolbox at concurrency 3 on a Mac with a GPU, checked when the browser opens; today's software
  path (no swangle) on a machine without one; VideoToolbox chosen before the render (a probe through the compositor's
  ffmpeg, each side ≤ 4096; 0.13 bit per pixel per frame, a key frame every 2 s); one guarded software re-render when
  the GPU path fails; a guarded render never lets Remotion open a browser of its own; the `render:` block in
  retake.yaml and `RETAKE_RENDER_*`; the record says what was asked, resolved and used; doctor's Renders line; tests
  pinned to the software path. Measured: 1080p 454 → 186 cpu-s, 77 → 64 s; 4K 1 380 → 438 cpu-s, 210 → 103 s. Two
  independent reviews fixed with mutation-checked tests. Cuts: BL-152 – BL-159. The captures-first acceptance on the GPU
  path did not pass its bars (one take 55.1 against 56.7; R-CAP-03): to re-run on an idle Mac. Next: the audit, then
  the first release.

### L5.17 – L5.18 — Hardening before the first release (decided 2026-11-05)
The app updates itself, so whatever a release ships reaches every installed Mac: the person decided to harden the tool
before tagging v0.2.0, in two lots — L5.17, then L5.18 for the rest — with the defaults proposed for each choice.

### L5.17 — Hardening before the first release (L)
- **Goal:** what an agent asks for is shown in full and held to plain rules, a scenario opens only the sites it should,
  every browser keeps Chromium's sandbox and site isolation, and a release is built and signed from checked inputs only.
- **Done (2026-11-05, in a worktree; pending the person's review of the pull request):** approvals and hooks — a job
  runs the scenario bytes it was submitted with; the approval form shows every hook in full, within 4,000 characters
  per hook and 16,000 per form; a hook an agent wrote sets no loader variable, and its shell commands are plain words
  joined by ` && ` with rules per word (no secret, rollbacks checked again on replay); an agent's prune asks the person
  first. URLs and browsers — one rule for the URLs a scenario opens (http:, https: or about:blank; under agent trust
  the environment's origins), checked at validation, submit, by the worker and by the runner, and a browser-level guard
  against file:; every capture browser in Chromium's OS sandbox with site isolation, checked on the running browser;
  `browser.args` refusing the switches that undo them; the notification and cursor bindings answering the main frame
  only, within limits; sign-in details in an environment page URL given as HTTP credentials for that origin. Renders —
  a patch of Remotion's renderer: the render browser sandboxed with site isolation on macOS, the bundle server on
  loopback only; the app's stage refuses an unpatched renderer. The release workflow — no cache, Node.js from its
  checked tarball, pnpm by its hash, a sign job that unpacks and runs only what it checked, the app's version checked
  before anything is signed. Requirements R-SEC-11 – R-SEC-28. Cuts: BL-160, BL-161. Next: L5.18, then the first
  release v0.2.0 (the person tags).

### L5.18 — Hardening before the first release, the rest
- **Goal:** the rest of the hardening decided on 2026-11-05, before the v0.2.0 tag. Scoped and sized when it starts.

### L5.3 – L5.4, L6
Scopes are listed per requirement in REQUIREMENTS.md (`--lot`); they will be detailed here when phase 2 is done, with
the same structure (goal, scope, acceptance, packages, size). Key contracts already written: SPEC §8 (MCP tools),
§11 (components), §12 (Studio app), DESIGN-phase2 §4 (frame comments), the canvas mock-ups (screens 1–7) and
`docs/design-brief.md`.
