```

Global options: `-C, --root <dir>` (workspace), `-v, --verbose` (info/debug messages), `--no-color`.

- **validate** checks `project.yaml`, the project template (all assets present) and one scenario — or every scenario
  when none is given. Messages read `file:line:col severity path: message`, with "did you mean" suggestions.
- **run** prints one line per step with its duration and a summary with the output paths. `--dry` records nothing,
  saves a screenshot per step and never executes `irreversible` steps (it hovers their target and stops that scene).
  Hooks run by default for captures and are skipped for dry runs (`--hooks run` executes them, so a dry run sees the
  same prepared data). `--until scene.step` stops after that step. `--json` streams progress events (one JSON object
  per line) on stdout for tools and agents. Ctrl-C (or SIGTERM) cancels cleanly: teardown still runs, the browser
  closes, the run ends `cancelled` with exit code 1; a second Ctrl-C quits at once. On a read-only environment
  a run with hooks that write is refused before anything runs; `--allow-writes` lets a production environment whose
  project.yaml allows writes be written to — see [Environments](environments.md#environments-display-urls-production-read-only-clock).
  `--sandbox` starts the sandbox environment if needed and resets it to its seed before the take — see
  [Sandbox mode](sandbox.md#sandbox-mode).
- **inspect** replays a page (an environment page key with `--path`, or a URL of one of its pages) or a scenario up to
  `--until` as a dry run (hooks skipped), then lists the page's visible interactive elements — dialogs and menus first
  — with a target the runner resolves to each, its action, and why it may be fragile; `--target` checks your own
  targets, `--within` lists inside one. Files in `<project>/.retake/inspect/<id>/` (or `--out`), with a marked
  screenshot; `--json` prints the report. What `page_inspect` gives Claude — see
  [Authoring](mcp.md#mcp-claude-drives-retake).
- **sandbox** starts, seeds, resets and stops the sandboxes of a project, shows their state and their services' logs —
  see [Sandbox mode](sandbox.md#sandbox-mode).
- **hooks run** runs a scenario's setup or teardown, the project's `reset` hooks, or a YAML file listing hooks (same
  entries as `setup:`). Its journal (executed hooks and their rollbacks) is kept in
  `<project>/.retake/journals/<id>.json` — never in `runs/`, which only holds captures; **hooks rollback**
  replays the pending rollbacks of one journal (a run id or a journal id) or of every journal; **env reset** replays
  every pending journal (captures' and standalone ones), then runs the `reset` hooks (journaled in
  `.retake/journals/` too). Both list every pending rollback before replaying it; one that Retake did not record in
  that journal with your Retake home (its entry is not signed: a journal from before this version, from another home,
  moved, copied or placed by something else) is shown in full — every field as it would run — and not replayed: the
  command exits 1, `--dry` exits 0. A person replays it with `--replay-unsigned`, in an interactive terminal only,
  which asks about each one (y/N, no by default); an unsigned `sql` or `js` rollback, one that uses a secret, or a
  `shell` one on a sandbox environment is never replayed (do it by hand if it is right), and a `shell` one runs without
  the rest of your terminal's environment. A signed rollback is replayed once. `--yes` approves destructive hooks that lack `confirm: true` (otherwise you are
  asked on a terminal, or they are refused). On a read-only environment, hooks that write are refused; a replayed
  rollback is judged by the environment its hook ran in (`--allow-writes` where that is a production environment
  that allows writes).
- **login** signs a persona in and saves its session: a visible browser window (sign in, then close it) or, with
  `--auto`, the persona's `login:` steps, headless; **auth status** lists every persona's session (from the last check,
  or checked now with `--check`) — see [Signing in](environments.md#signing-in-personas-and-sessions).
- **doctor** checks, one line each with `OK`, `WARN` or `FAIL` and a hint: the Node.js version, Chromium (path,
  version and a real new-headless launch), its sandbox (**Chromium sandbox**: read from the launched browser's own
  command line — a failure when it holds a switch that turns the sandbox or site isolation off, which only an
  executable that adds switches itself can do; a Chromium that does not start as root on Linux says to run as a
  regular user), **Renders** (L5.15: what a 1080p render gets here — the GPU the render
  browser reports, VideoToolbox, the frames at a time, and the `render:` settings / `RETAKE_RENDER_*` variables set,
  with their source; see [Renders on the GPU](editing.md#renders-on-the-gpu)), ffmpeg and ffprobe (5.1 or later), a display (only needed by `--headed` and `login`),
  the secrets store for `{{keychain:…}}` refs (macOS `security`, Linux `secret-tool`), desktop notifications
  (`osascript`, `notify-send`), Docker (its version, Compose v2.17 or later, a running daemon, the context — found on
  PATH, else where Docker Desktop, OrbStack or Homebrew put it, as the sandboxes look for it: a warning when missing,
  since only docker-compose sandboxes need it, and a failure only when the `--project`'s default sandbox — its
  `default_env` when that is a sandbox, else the first one declared — is a docker-compose one), the workspace root
  and its projects, and the fonts of every template (the starter templates included). With
  `--project <slug>` it also checks that project's sessions — one line per persona (never signed in, expired, in use
  by a browser, its last check), the Retake home (a warning when it, or a session, sits inside a git work tree that
  does not ignore it), the profile of the single-account form — and sends a `HEAD`
  request (5 s timeout) to every page of every environment: an unreachable page of the default environment is a
  failure, of another environment a warning. A sandbox gets one line instead (up and healthy, or how to start it):
  its accounts sign in at every take and its pages answer only while it runs. It exits with `1` when any check fails; `--json` prints the checks.
- **components** lists, validates and scaffolds components — see [Components](themes-and-components.md#components).
- **plan** shows how a capture will be edited (segments, components, speeds, trims, zooms, captions, warnings)
  without rendering — see [Editing](editing.md#editing-the-edit-plan).
- **render** plans and renders the latest capture of a scenario (or `--run`) into `renders/<scenario>-v<N>.mp4` with a
  progress bar and a summary; **still** renders one frame of the planned video as a PNG — see
  [Rendering](editing.md#rendering).
- **review** writes contact sheets, per-scene sheets, key frames, an output-time timeline and a report of a render,
  and prints the findings of its checks — see [Reviewing a render](review.md#reviewing-a-render).
- **comment** leaves a comment on one frame of a render (optionally a region), lists threads, replies, resolves and
  reopens them — see [Frame comments](review.md#frame-comments).
- **export** writes delivery files of a render to `exports/<render-id>/` with a `manifest.json` — see
  [Variants, 4K, music and export](editing.md#variants-4k-music-and-export).
- **export-capture** (and **run --raw**) writes the raw package of a run for another editing tool — clips per scene,
  cursor data or layer, FCPXML / EDL / OTIO / CSV markers, `manifest.json` — see
  [Raw export for editors](editing.md#raw-export-for-editors).
- **mcp** serves Retake's tools to an MCP client over stdio (Claude Code, Claude desktop); `--print-config`
  prints how to register it; `--http` serves them over HTTP on `127.0.0.1` instead (`--port`, default 47820;
  `--rotate-token`; `--json`: one line `{type, url, port, pid}`), `--print-config --http` prints that registration
  (the token by reference only, never the token itself) — see [MCP: Claude drives Retake](mcp.md#mcp-claude-drives-retake).
- **record** `<project> [name] [--env] [--persona] [--page] [--path | --url] [--allow-writes] [--no-check] [--json]`
  opens a browser window on the environment's page: perform the flow by hand, then close the window (or press Ctrl-C:
  stop and keep). Nothing is filmed. A draft scenario is made from what you did — verified targets, `select` / `pick` /
  `menu` / `drop_file` steps, scenes split where the page changed, empty captions, secret fields as
  `{{vars.password_1}}` placeholders (set a showable demo value) — saved as `scenarios/<name>.yaml` when the name is
  free (default `recorded-YYYYMMDD-HHMM`; an existing scenario is never overwritten), then checked by a headless dry
  replay (up to the step before the first write that reached a server, whatever its host). The recording's
  files stay in `<project>/.retake/records/` (the newest 20). The access is the environment's own, as a run.
  See [Recording a scenario](scenarios.md#recording-a-scenario).
- **ui** serves the Studio web app of the workspace on `127.0.0.1` until Ctrl-C and opens it in the browser
  (`--no-open`: print the link only; `--port`: a fixed port; `--json`: one line `{type, v, url, port, pid, reused,
  player}` (`v` 1) — `player` the preview's origin; `--supervised`: `--json --no-open` for the desktop app (its line says
  `v` 2: what Quit would leave behind and the job ends follow it, one JSON line each), and it stops when its stdin
  closes, saying why on stderr: `stopped: SIGTERM`, `stopped: stdin closed`); one server per workspace — run it
  again to reopen the running one with a new link — see [Studio app](studio.md#studio-app) and
  [Desktop app (macOS)](desktop-app.md#desktop-app-macos).

Exit codes: `0` success, `1` validation errors or a failed/cancelled run or hook (or a failed doctor check), `2`
invalid command line, `130` interrupted (Ctrl-C) while signing in, checking a session, running js hooks or starting,
resetting or stopping a sandbox.
