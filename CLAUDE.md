# Retake — notes for Claude Code

Retake turns a written scenario (YAML) into a finished product video: it drives a real web app headless with an
in-page cursor, captures it, edits it automatically with themeable components (Remotion), reviews the result (contact
sheets, checks) and exports it — or exports the raw capture for an editing tool. TypeScript pnpm monorepo, Node ≥ 22.
The current goal is **a local tool for our own use**; selling it is a later topic (`docs/BACKLOG.md`).
Before L5.13 the tool was called Demo Studio (command `studio`, home `~/.demo-studio`, workspace file `studio.yaml`, variables `DEMO_STUDIO_*`): nothing reads those names any more — `retake doctor` says what to move; the old names the code still knows live in `packages/{core,engine}/src/legacy.ts` only. <!-- old-name: the history line -->

## Read first
1. `docs/HANDOFF.md` — state, Mac setup, order of the next lots, decisions, notes per lot. **Always start here.**
2. `docs/ROADMAP.md` — lots, status, working agreement; `node scripts/requirements.mjs --lot <id>` lists a lot's
   requirements (source of truth: `docs/requirements.json`).
3. `docs/SPEC.md` (brief), `docs/DESIGN.md` + `docs/DESIGN-phase2.md` (contracts), `docs/reference/look.md`
   (target look), `README.md` (the front page) and `docs/guide/` (usage, scenario language, CLI: the reference).
4. `docs/AGENTS.md` — how a lot is run with sub-agents (plan, critique, worktree, reviews, fixes) and the rules every
   sub-agent follows.

## Working agreement
- **One lot at a time**; the user decides how many lots to chain. Don't start the next lot unasked.
- A lot is done when: `pnpm build` and the **full** test suite are green, the lot's acceptance is checked (real runs,
  renders reviewed, frames looked at), `docs/requirements.json` is updated (status / evidence / gap, then
  `node scripts/requirements.mjs`), `docs/HANDOFF.md` and the ROADMAP status are updated — then **one clean commit
  per lot** on `main`, pushed, and a short report.
- A lot that adds or changes a component regenerates its committed `preview.png` (`retake components preview`).
- **The tool stays generic**: no client, brand or person names anywhere (code, docs, fixtures, templates, tests,
  commit messages). The fixture product "Northfield" and the placeholder brands are invented.
  Exception: the licence texts under `apps/desktop/licenses/` keep the names and URLs their licences require.
- **MVP scope is locked** to the lots in the ROADMAP. A new idea goes to `docs/BACKLOG.md` (maintained by hand,
  unprioritised), not into a lot.
- No new dependency without a strong reason; never commit `runs/`, `renders/`, `review/`, `exports/` or videos.

## Language
Everything in the repository is in English. The user writes in French: **answer the user in French.**

## Git
Work on `main` (clone / pull `main`). The cloud working branch `claude/new-session-pq6jtq` is history only.
Commit messages end with the attribution lines the harness gives.

## Everyday commands (from the repository root)
```sh
pnpm install                         # once, and after a dependency change
pnpm build                           # = tsc -b (typecheck + dist/)
pnpm test                            # = vitest run, full suite (~20 min on the Mac; run `pnpm build` first; 104 skip by default: slow, captures first, installed Chrome, desktop app, app bundle, updater, Postgres, Docker, old Node, headed)
                                     # export RETAKE_HOME to a scratch folder for every command (vitest gives a test run a temp one)
                                     # never export RETAKE_CAPTURES_DIR for a suite: vitest gives each test file its own markers folder
                                     # the suite pins renders to the software path (RETAKE_RENDER_*; children: packages/core/test/child-env.ts)
pnpm test:pg                         # the 7 Postgres tests on a throwaway retake-pg-test-* container (~5 s; --all: whole suite with Postgres, Docker and slow tests)
pnpm test:slow                       # catalogue capture, MCP loops, theme, plugin, phase-3 and Studio acceptances, every browser launch site sandboxed (launch-options.test.ts) (~13 min)

## Where things live
- `packages/core` scenario language, schemas, validation · `packages/runner-web` headless capture, in-page kit, raw
  export (`src/raw/`) · `packages/hooks` setup/teardown hooks · `packages/components` component system, kit,
  built-in library (`library/studio/*`), scaffolds · `packages/editor` planner (`planEdit`), Remotion compositions
  (`src/remotion/`), render / export · `packages/review` contact sheets, checks, report · `packages/cli` the `retake`
  command · `packages/sandbox` sandbox engine (process and docker-compose providers, Postgres snapshots, `init`
  scaffold) · `packages/engine` engine API shared by the CLI and MCP, job queue and worker · `packages/mcp` the MCP
  server (`retake mcp`, stdio and HTTP, SDK imported only in `src/server.ts`) · `packages/ui` the Studio web app and its
  server (`retake ui`; design system in `src/app/ui-kit` + `tokens.ts`, reference `docs/reference/studio-ui.md`) · `apps/desktop` the macOS app (Tauri shell around `retake ui --supervised`) · `skills/` the Claude skills and plugin root.
- `fixtures/wholesale` the fictional product filmed by the tests; `projects/northfield-fixture` its project
  (scenarios, hooks, assets; generated `runs/`, `renders/`, `review/`, `exports/` are git-ignored);
  `templates/` starter themes (default, editorial, motion); `scripts/` helpers; `docs/` everything else.
- A user's own material lives in their own workspace folder (`RETAKE_ROOT` or a `retake.yaml`), never here.
