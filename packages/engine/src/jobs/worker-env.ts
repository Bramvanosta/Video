/**
 * The environment of a jobs worker a client starts (L4.2, critique B5; review A #3, B L5). A dry run or a capture runs
 * in the worker, which keeps the environment it was started with and serves every later job of the workspace — so any
 * client but the CLI (the Studio, an MCP client, a test) hands it a clean one, never more than a worker started from a
 * terminal (`retake worker`) needs:
 *
 * - PATH sanitised like `retake mcp`'s (core clientPath): absolute entries only, none a package manager added for the
 *   script it runs (`node_modules/.bin`, corepack), none inside the workspace under any spelling (an agent writes files
 *   there), the node that runs the client first, Homebrew / system folders completed;
 * - no variable a package manager sets for a script (`npm_*`, `pnpm_*`, `INIT_CWD`: `npm_config_*` may carry a
 *   registry token), no MCP HTTP token (the worker never calls the MCP server), no credential of a model or of the
 *   tools around an agent (ANTHROPIC_*, CLAUDE_* / CLAUDECODE, OPENAI_*, AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK, Gemini / Mistral /
 *   … keys, GitHub / npm tokens): the tool never calls a model nor a registry;
 * - nothing that makes node or the system load code from the workspace: NODE_OPTIONS naming a file to load
 *   (`--require`, `--import`, `--loader`…: a relative one resolves in the worker's cwd, the workspace), NODE_PATH /
 *   DYLD_* / LD_PRELOAD / LD_LIBRARY_PATH holding a relative entry or one inside the workspace;
 * - no tool variable naming a relative path (`RETAKE_FFMPEG`, `RETAKE_FFPROBE`, `RETAKE_CHROMIUM`,
 *   `RETAKE_CHROMIUM_HEADLESS_SHELL` = `tools/x`: it would resolve in the worker's cwd, the workspace, and name another
 *   file than in the client — L5.16; core refuses one anyway);
 * - RETAKE_HOME kept, made absolute (the signed-in profiles live there; the worker's cwd is the workspace).
 *
 * Everything else stays: an automated sign-in's `{{env:NAME}}` secrets (project.yaml) are read by the worker from its
 * environment, as for a worker started in a terminal.
